<h1>THE BRONCHO RIDER BOYS WITH<br />
FUNSTON AT VERA CRUZ.</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>A DARING ADVENTURE.</h3>


<p>"Let me look, Billie," and Donald reached out
his hand for the field glass through which Broncho
Billie was gazing down from the summit of Real
del Monte upon the plain of Quesco, through which
the Pachuca river winds its way. "Maybe I can
make out who they are."</p>

<p>Billie handed over the glass without a word and
stood expectant, while Donald scrutinized closely
a body of horsemen&mdash;twenty or more in number&mdash;which
had halted beside the railroad that connects
the little city of Pachuca with the City of Mexico.</p>

<p>"They are not soldiers, that's certain," was Donald's
comment after he had inspected the riders carefully
for a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," from Billie. "They
look like a bunch of <i>vaqueros</i> to me; but what
would a crowd of fifty cowpunchers be doing in a
country where the only cattle are goats?"</p>

<p>"That's right!" laughed Donald, greatly amused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
at Billie's odd expression, "but still that is what they
appear to be. Perhaps they are expecting a drove
of cattle up on the train."</p>

<p>"More likely they are expecting a load of bullion
going down to the City of Mexico," remarked the
third of the party. "What do you think, Pedro?"
turning to the fourth of the boys who composed the
quartette.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are right, Adrian," replied
Pedro, with an accent which denoted that of the
four he was the only one who was not of an English-speaking
race.</p>

<p>"You don't think they would hold up a train in
broad daylight, and that not more than five miles
from town, do you?" queried Billie.</p>

<p>"If they are what I suspect," declared Pedro, "I
think they would hold it up at the station, if there
were only a few more of them."</p>

<p>"And what do you think they are?"</p>

<p>"I think they are Zapatistas."</p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Followers of the bandit leader, Emilio Zapata."</p>

<p>"Which side does he belong to?" asked Adrian.
"Huerta or Carranza?"</p>

<p>"Neither. He is simply a bandit, and his followers
prey upon any whom they find unprotected."</p>

<p>"And do you really think they are going to hold
up and rob the train from Pachuca?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sin duda!</i>" meaning without doubt.</p>

<p>"Then we must prevent them," declared Donald<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
emphatically.</p>

<p>"What business is it of ours?" asked Billie. "If
one bunch of Mexicans wants to rob another bunch,
especially if the second bunch are Huertistas, I
don't know that it is for us to interfere. I'm not
looking for trouble."</p>

<p>"You're not afraid, are you? If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, Don," interrupted Billie, "what's the use of
always asking such foolish questions? If I remember
rightly, the last time you asked me that question
was up on the Rio Grande a year ago, about the
time that I was swimming rivers and breaking into
prisons with the Texas Rangers to get you and Ad
out of trouble. Now why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Donald held up both hands.</p>

<p>"That's enough, Billie," he laughed. "I'll take
it all back. Of course you're not afraid. But I
insist we must prevent this hold-up."</p>

<p>"And again I ask, why?"</p>

<p>"Because there may be women and children on
the train and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough," exclaimed Billie. "You needn't
go on with the rest. But what's the plan? We're
a good ten miles from those chaps&mdash;unless we had
an airship."</p>

<p>"And then how far do you think it is?" queried
Adrian.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Billie slowly, as he squinted up
one eye, "I should say they are about four miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
away as the crow flies. But we are not crows. By
the Real road, it is at least ten miles."</p>

<p>"There must be a short cut somewhere," insisted
Donald.</p>

<p>"There is," explained Pedro. "Just around the
next turn in the road there is a goat path that leads
down to the river. If you are not afraid of getting
wet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There you go," laughed Billie. "Afraid of getting
wet! Just let's settle it once for all that we
are not afraid of anything that it is right for us
to do."</p>

<p>Pedro laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, since we are not afraid of getting
wet, we can follow the river for about two miles
by fording it several times, and emerge on the
plain a mile this side of the clump of trees which
hides those fellows from the highway."</p>

<p>"And then what?" from Billie.</p>

<p>"That is as far as I've gone."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to do better. Just as soon
as we emerge from behind those trees, we'll be a
fair target. Four against twenty is 'most too much
on an open plain."</p>

<p>For several minutes no one spoke. It was Adrian
who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"I think I see a way, not only to save the train,
but possibly to capture the bandits."</p>

<p>The boys looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you notice how the railroad curves in toward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the hills just after it crosses the river bridge?" he
continued, pointing out the place he meant.</p>

<p>"Sure, we see it," from Billie.</p>

<p>"Well, when we leave the river, instead of riding
toward that bunch of trees, we'll ride the other way.
That will bring us to the railroad track near the
curve. Then we'll ride up the track. If we do
not reach the station before the train leaves, we
can flag it. There is sure to be at least half a dozen
guards aboard. We will make ten. Most of the
men aboard will have revolvers. The result will be
that instead of the bandits taking the train by surprise,
we will take them by surprise, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the army that takes the other by surprise
wins," finished Billie, taking off his sombrero and
bowing to Adrian in mock gravity. Then to Pedro,
"Let the scout lead the way and the army will
fall in behind, with the general at the head."</p>

<p>A laugh followed Billie's words, and putting
spurs to their horses, the four lads dashed down
the mountain road upon their self-appointed mission,
which was by no means the first daring adventure
in which they had engaged; for the stories
of the doings of the three American lads in the
quartette have furnished interesting reading for
thousands of American boys.</p>

<p>It is because of their numerous adventures and
their skill as horsemen that the trio has become
known as the Broncho Rider Boys. Their names
are Donald Mackay, Adrian Sherwood and William
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Stonewall Jackson Winkle, better known as
"Broncho Billie." This latter name was given him
some two years before when he went to visit his
cousin Donald at the latter's home on the Keystone
Ranch in Wyoming. It was not given him because
he was such an expert rider, but because he could
fall from his broncho pony easier than any boy
in that section. Rotund in appearance, he was as
jolly as he was fat, and his chief failing was his appetite.
No matter what the hour, no one ever mentioned
eats that Billie was not hungry.</p>

<p>When he first came West he was supposed to be
in poor health. It speedily developed that such was
not the case. He was simply hungry. Months in
the open air had enabled him to eat without fear
and he was now about the most robust specimen of
boy that any one ever saw.</p>

<p>Donald, the oldest of the trio, was one of those
level-headed chaps who had a knack of doing the
right thing at the right time. His judgment had
been proven good in many a tight place and under
many thrilling conditions. As a result, he was generally
looked up to as a leader by the others, although
it must be admitted that Adrian was also
a lad of sense and plenty of nerve.</p>

<p>Adrian was the owner of a large Wyoming ranch,
and one of the books which has proved most interesting
to American boys is known as The Broncho
Rider Boys on the Wyoming Trail, a story of how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" href="#Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Adrian saved his property from being taken away
from him by a dishonest uncle.</p>

<p>About a year previous to the time this story
opens, these three boys had been on a trip along the
Rio Grande, when they fell in with Capt. June Peak
and a company of Texas Rangers, who had been
detailed to keep watch of the actions of a band of
cattle smugglers. Sent across the river into Mexican
territory on a secret mission, the Broncho Rider
Boys had the good fortune to rescue Pedro Sanchez,
the fourth member of the quartette, from the hands
of a band of ruffians. Pedro turned out to be the
son of Gen. Sanchez of the Mexican army, who was
visiting an uncle in northern Mexico. After a
series of thrilling adventures, which are told in full
in The Broncho Rider Boys with the Texas Rangers,
Donald, Adrian and Billie returned to their homes,
promising to visit Pedro in the City of Mexico
whenever the time was ripe.</p>

<p>During the time that the boys were scouting in
Mexico they had learned to speak Spanish quite
well, and this knowledge had been so improved during
their visit with Pedro that they now spoke the
language well, an accomplishment which proved of
much value to them later on.</p>

<p>About a month prior to the day upon which this
story opens, the three Americans had met by appointment
at New York City and had come to Vera
Cruz by boat and thence to the City of Mexico,
where they found everything in a greatly disturbed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
condition because of the revolution which had been
started some months previous by Gen. Carranza.</p>

<p>It might be well right here to state briefly the history
of the previous few months in Mexico, so that
all may understand how it happened that none of
the four boys had a very high opinion of Gen.
Huerta, at that time dictator of Mexico.</p>

<p>For nearly 35 years, up to 1911, Mexico had a
peaceful existence under a republican form of government.
During the last 32 years of that time
Porfirio Diaz was president. Just prior to 1912 a
revolution was begun against what had come to be
called the Diaz government, and Diaz was compelled
to flee from Mexico. The revolution was
headed by Francisco Madero, who was then made
president.</p>

<p>In February of 1913 a revolution was started
against President Madero by Felix Diaz, nephew
of Porfirio Diaz, and the City of Mexico was attacked.
At that time Gen. Huerta was in command
of Madero's forces in the City of Mexico. He
proved a traitor to Madero, went over to Diaz, arrested
Madero and confined him in prison. Two
days later, April 22, 1913, President Madero was
shot by order of Huerta, who then declared himself
dictator. At the same time he asked that the other
nations of the earth recognize him as the head of
the Mexican government, a thing which the government
of the United States refused to do.</p>

<p>March 26, 1913, another revolution was started,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
this time against Gen. Huerta by Gen. Carranza,
governor of the state of Chihuahua. This revolution
had been in progress more than a year when
this story opens.</p>

<p>Pedro's father, Gen. Sanchez, had been a friend
of President Madero. When Madero was shot,
Gen. Sanchez fled to Pachuca where he had a large
hacienda and also owned vast interests in the silver
mines at Real del Monte, some six miles up the
mountains. Later, however, he was promised protection
by Gen. Huerta, who was anxious to have
the friendship of such a prominent man, and returned
to the City of Mexico. It was some time
after this, about March 1, 1914&mdash;when matters
had quieted down in the City of Mexico&mdash;that the
three American boys went to visit Pedro.</p>

<p>A few days previous to the one on which we find
the four boys headed for the railroad to foil the
would-be train robbers, they had come to Pachuca,
which is located some sixty miles from the City of
Mexico, on horses furnished them by Gen. Sanchez,
to see the mines and the beautiful mountains overlooking
the plains of Quesco. Every day they took
long rides in various directions, in spite of the unsettled
condition of the country&mdash;a condition which
compelled them always to go armed with their
trusty Marlins and Colts&mdash;and that is how they
happened to be on the Real road at such an opportune
time.</p>

<p>With these explanations, it is no wonder that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the boys were keen for the adventure upon which
they were now embarked.</p>

<p>A sharp ride of fifteen minutes brought them to
the river and into it the horses plunged. At places
it was only knee deep and at other places where they
were obliged to cross it was necessary for the horses
to swim; but this was only fun for the Broncho
Rider Boys.</p>

<p>Half an hour after sighting the bandits, the boys
halted on the railroad track, well secreted from
their quarry by the curve before mentioned.</p>

<p>"And none too soon," declared Donald as the
sharp whistle of the engine was heard perhaps half
a mile away.</p>

<p>"How shall we flag her?" asked Pedro.</p>

<p>"With that red bandana handkerchief on Billie's
neck," replied Donald as he reached over and
snatched the neckwear from its place.</p>

<p>Springing from his horse, he ran up the track
waving the red signal as he ran.</p>

<p>A sharp blast from the whistle a couple of minutes
later gave proof that the danger signal had
been seen, and the grinding of the brakes told that
the train was coming to a stop. Even before this
was an accomplished fact the conductor swung himself
from the front car and came running down the
track to see what was the matter, while the guards
covered the boys with their carbines.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by stopping the train?" he
demanded angrily.</p>

<p>Donald explained in as few words as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The conductor signalled the guards to him and
told them what Donald had said.</p>

<p>"What had we better do?" asked the conductor.</p>

<p>"We had better go back to Pachuca for help,"
replied the guards.</p>

<p>"And let the Zapatistas escape!" exclaimed Billie
hotly. "What do you want to do that for?"</p>

<p>"We have only six guards," the conductor explained,
"and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that, with us, makes ten," interrupted
Billie.</p>

<p>The conductor regarded the boy with surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean you will join us to help capture
the bandits?"</p>

<p>"What do you think we're here for?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"Yes," chimed in Adrian. "What do you suppose
we stopped the train for?"</p>

<p>"But even ten are no match for twenty or more,"
declared the guard.</p>

<p>"Of course they are," said Donald, "if the twenty
are taken by surprise."</p>

<p>"Which they will not be if we don't act pretty
quick," insisted Billie. "Come on! Let's go after
them," and he climbed up onto the car.</p>

<p>"That's what I say," said Pedro, following Billie's
example.</p>

<p>Without more words the others followed and
the conductor gave the signal to go ahead.</p>

<p>"How about the horses?" asked Donald, turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to Pedro.</p>

<p>"They'll be all right; but if we capture the Zapatistas
we'll have horses enough any way."</p>

<p>"And if we don't," remarked Billie grimly,
"there'll be some riderless horses any way."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that they will not be the ones we
have left behind," said Donald gravely.</p>

<h3>A STRANGE MIX-UP.</h3>


<p>While the train was gathering headway the conductor
and the guards rounded up all the men they
could find on the train who were armed. There
were more than a dozen, so that in point of numbers,
the force on the train nearly equalled the
Zapatistas. These were so stationed at the windows
that they could give the would-be robbers a warm
reception.</p>

<p>"We must use some strategy," declared Adrian,
"or we will simply succeed in killing a few and
scaring away the others. That will not be a very
brilliant deed."</p>

<p>"No," from Donald, "but it will save the bullion.
What's your plan?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was thinking it would be a good plan to
separate the train."</p>

<p>"How?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can see it is all down grade from here to
where the bandits are waiting for us."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"As soon as we get to running a good speed, Billie
and I will go into the express car with the three
guards. You and Pedro stay here with the other
guards and the passengers. As we near the bandits,
uncouple the train, put on the brakes and stop the
coaches. We will rush by with the engine and express
car, firing as we go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which will be all right," interrupted Billie, "if
they don't ditch the engine."</p>

<p>Adrian's face fell.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better."</p>

<p>After a moment Adrian's face brightened.</p>

<p>"They might better ditch the engine and express
car than the whole train," he declared.</p>

<p>"Right you are," from Donald. "If you and Billie
are game enough to try it, I say it is the proper
thing. If they ditch the engine, we will be back a
ways and can run down to your assistance. If they
don't ditch you, we will have them between two
fires."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought," replied Adrian. "How
about it, Billie?"</p>

<p>"I'm game. My head may be a little thick, but
I can see just as far through a two-inch plank as
the next one."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Come on," and Adrian led the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
way into the car ahead, while Donald and Pedro
stood by to uncouple as soon as they passed the
clump of trees before alluded to.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant several sharp blasts
from the whistle gave the danger signal, and Donald
threw over the coupling lever and put on the
brake. The coaches slowed quickly down, but the
engine and express car dashed in between the horsemen
stationed on either side of the track.</p>

<p>Prepared for what they knew was coming, the
engineer and fireman had thrown themselves down
on the floor of the cab, while Adrian, Billie and the
three guards poured a volley into the robbers as
they passed and several horses lost their mounts.</p>

<p>This fire was followed by a fusillade from the
horsemen and a minute later the engine, striking an
unspiked rail, rolled completely over into the ditch,
wrenching itself clear from the express car, which,
after bumping over the ties for several seconds, suddenly
ceased its antics and glided smoothly along.</p>

<p>As by a miracle it had run completely over the
space from which the rail had been loosed and
landed upon the good track, down which it now
sped.</p>

<p>So unexpected was the change from ties to track
that Adrian and Billie were unable for a few moments
to understand what had happened. Then
Billie rushed to the door and seized the hand brake.</p>

<p>"Grab hold and help stop this car," he yelled to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Adrian, "or there is no knowing where we'll land."</p>

<p>Adrian hastened to obey, but the wrench that had
been given the car when the engine broke loose had
put the brake out of commission and the car sped on.</p>

<p>The three Mexican guards now appeared on the
platform and gazed wildly up the track where they
could see the fight going on between the bandits and
their companions.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Se&ntilde;or?" asked one of them.</p>

<p>"Search me," from Billie. "How long is this
grade?"</p>

<p>"It is down hill all the way to Pitahaya."</p>

<p>"How far is that?"</p>

<p>"Ten kilometers from Pachuca."</p>

<p>"That must be about three miles farther," said
Adrian.</p>

<p>"Correct," from Billie, "but unless it's a mighty
steep up-grade the other side of Pita-what's-its-name,
we're going so fast we'll not stop till we've
run away past it."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? We can coast back, can't
we?"</p>

<p>The car gave a lurch to one side that almost
threw the boys off the platform.</p>

<p>"We're certainly going some," called Adrian.
"Hang on!"</p>

<p>And hang on they did until they dashed past the
little station of Pitahaya and after several minutes
began to slow down.</p>

<p>"This is a little better," Adrian finally remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
as the car showed some sign of coming to a stop.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," from Billie. "I suppose we'll
come to a dead stop soon. Do you think she'll start
back on her own hook, or shall we have to start
her?"</p>

<p>"We'll soon see," and see they did, for a couple
of minutes later the car came to a stop.</p>

<p>For some minutes the five occupants of the car
waited to see if it would start back down the grade.
When it did not they got off to decide what could
be done.</p>

<p>"It's a mighty steep hill," Billie ventured.
"Looks as though the five of us ought to start it.
Let's try."</p>

<p>The five put their shoulders against the car and
pushed with all their might, but it refused to budge.</p>

<p>"If we only had a crowbar," said Adrian, "we
could start it in a jiffy. Suppose some of you look
in the car. There might be one there."</p>

<p>The three Mexicans jumped to obey.</p>

<p>Directly they appeared in the doorway with a
large claw-bar in their hands.</p>

<p>"Will this do?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Sure! Throw it off," said Billie, "and I'll soon
start the old caboose."</p>

<p>Picking up the bar, Billie inserted the claw under
one of the wheels while Adrian stood with his hand
on the car rail ready to spring aboard.</p>

<p>At the first attempt the claw slipped and nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
happened, but at the second attempt the wheels
yielded a little.</p>

<p>"This time she'll go," Billie called. "All aboard!"</p>

<p>Adrian sprang onto the car as Billie bore down
upon the bar and the wheels began to revolve.</p>

<p>"Never mind the bar," cried Adrian as he saw
that Billie was raising the implement to throw it
onto the platform. "Jump aboard!"</p>

<p>Billie started to obey, but the advice came too
late. As he dropped the bar it struck one end of a
tie, flopped over and hit him on the shin.</p>

<p>"Wow!" he yelled, grabbing his ankle with both
hands.</p>

<p>"Never mind your leg," shouted Adrian. "Jump
on or you'll be left."</p>

<p>Billie tried to obey, but the car was now under
headway and although he sprinted his best, he was
soon left behind.</p>

<p>Adrian started to jump off the car, but seeing his
intention Billie called to him not to do it.</p>

<p>"I'll get there some time," he called. "Just tell
them I'm coming," and he stood in the middle of the
track looking ruefully after the rapidly disappearing
car.</p>

<p>After some moments he picked up the claw-bar
and threw it spitefully into the ditch beside the
track, as much as to say, "Lay there! You're the
cause of all the trouble." Then he started slowly
after the car.</p>

<p>In the meantime Adrian was flying as fast back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
toward Pachuca as he had been flying away from
it only a few minutes before. It could not have
been more than ten minutes altogether since the
wreck of the engine and Adrian figured that if the
grade were steep enough the car might gain momentum
enough to carry it back to the scene of the
trouble; but he had little hope that it would.</p>

<p>When he shot through Pitahaya on his return
trip, however, he saw that the car was going at a
terrific rate of speed.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he asked one of the Mexicans.
"Do you think we'll get all the way back?"</p>

<p>"Cierto," was the reply. "When they first built
this road they used to have mules haul the car to
the top of this hill and then turn it loose and it
would run almost to Pachuca. That was before it
had any engines."</p>

<p>Adrian looked at the man and winked one eye
very slowly.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or, it is true," spoke up another. "I was a
guard at the time."</p>

<p>Adrian could scarcely believe the statement, but
he afterward learned that the men spoke the truth.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "we had better look to
our arms, for we may need them. There is no
knowing how this affair has turned out."</p>

<p>The advice was well taken, for as they drew near
the scene of the wreck, they saw that they were
badly needed. More than a dozen horsemen were
in sight at some distance from the wreck and with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
their long-range rifles were doing their best to pick
off any one who showed his head.</p>

<p>"Our party must be out of ammunition," suggested
Adrian, "or they would give a better account
of themselves."</p>

<p>"Our carbines would not carry that far," explained
one of the guards.</p>

<p>"Our Marlins will," replied Adrian, and as he
spoke there were two simultaneous flashes from two
of the car windows and two of the bandits fell, one
shot from his horse and the other with his horse
shot under him.</p>

<p>For a moment the other horsemen hesitated as
to the course they should pursue and then, putting
spurs to their horses, they dashed toward the train,
just as the express car, having reached the end of
the track, bumped onto the ties and came to a stop.</p>

<p>"Now!" cried Adrian as the riders drew near,
firing as they came, and four shots rang out.</p>

<p>The volley from so unexpected a quarter took
the horsemen completely by surprise, and they
pulled up with a jerk. The action proved their undoing,
for as they stood thus for a moment, they
gave those in the train the opportunity they desired
and the volley that followed turned four more riderless
horses upon the plain.</p>

<p>It was more than flesh and blood could stand, and
the seven or eight remaining horsemen turned and
fled, followed by at least three whistling bullets
from as many Marlins.</p>

<p>The fight was over and the bullion had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
saved, but what of Broncho Billie, who had been
left at the top of the hill four miles away?</p>

<p>That was the first question asked by Donald when
he greeted Adrian two minutes later.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right," was the laughing reply.
"He's just taking a little walk for his health."</p>

<p>But when Billie failed to put in an appearance an
hour later, the boys mounted their horses and started
up the track to meet him, leading Billie's mount
between them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>BILLIE LOSES HIS NERVE.</h3>


<p>Broncho Billie was not a rapid walker. In
fact, if there was any one thing in which Billie
was not a success, it was walking. He could ride
a horse all day, but when it came to depending upon
his own legs as a means of locomotion, he was a
dead failure.</p>

<p>Therefore he walked slowly along, counting the
ties as he went.</p>

<p>"They certainly do lay 'em thick," he mused after
some minutes. "Three hundred and one, three hundred
and two, three hundred and three, three hundred
and four, three hun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked behind him.</p>

<p>"I sure thought I heard some one," he muttered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
"It must have been a bird."</p>

<p>He turned and started forward.</p>

<p>"Let's see, where was I? Oh, yes, three hundred
and five, three hundred and six, three hundred
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again he stopped, but did not turn around. Instead
he stooped down as though to pick up a stone,
which enabled him to look backward between his
knees.</p>

<p>He caught a movement in the grass at the edge
of the right of way.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he muttered. "Now to find out
who it is, and what he wants."</p>

<p>He picked up a small stone and threw it at a
tall cactus which grew near the track some distance
ahead.</p>

<p>"Good shot," he said aloud as the stone hit the
stalk. "I wonder if I could do it again."</p>

<p>He stooped down and picked up another stone,
taking a good look backward from his stooping
position. There was not a movement to indicate
the presence of a living thing.</p>

<p>"This is getting on my nerves," the boy mused
as he picked up several small stones and again
walked forward. "I don't mind being followed by
a white man, but I'm a whole lot leary of these
greasers. They're bad enough when they're
friendly."</p>

<p>Then aloud, as he threw a couple of stones: "I'll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
never get anywhere if I don't make better time
than this. I'll just sprint a few."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he started on a
run.</p>

<p>Almost immediately he was aware of a soft pat-pat
in his rear. He had heard a similar sound in
the wilds of Wyoming and he recognized it at once.</p>

<p>It was the footfall of a four-legged animal.</p>

<p>"So!" he ejaculated. "I wonder what it is. If
there were wolves down here I would say it was
a wolf, but I don't believe there are." Then a minute
later, "Well, whatever it is, I'm going to find
out."</p>

<p>He whipped out his automatic and turned suddenly.</p>

<p>As before, not a single living thing was in sight,
only in the grass a movement as before.</p>

<p>Without a moment's aim, he fired a single shot
at the spot. It was an act born of fear and Billie
knew it, but for the life of him he could not have
done otherwise, so nervous had he become.</p>

<p>The report was followed by a cry of pain and
an instant later there came running directly toward
him out of the tall grass a figure so weird that Billie
stood as one paralysed.</p>

<p>The figure was that of a man not more than two
feet high, with long arms and a head of diminutive
size. While it stood upright at times, at others it
came forward on all fours. To Billie it seemed a
cross between a man and a monkey.</p>

<p>Gathering his wits in an instant, Billie would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
fired again&mdash;in fact, raised his revolver to do so,
when the strange creature fell to its knees and raised
its hands in supplication.</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed the lad as he stood with
lowered weapon. "What kind of a thing is this?
I wonder if it can talk?"</p>

<p>Then as he took a step toward it: "I'm not going
to hurt you. Come here."</p>

<p>The creature arose to its feet and came slowly
toward him. As it did so Billie noticed that blood
was running from a wound in its scalp.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," he said. "That must have been
where the bullet hit him. It was a close shave."</p>

<p>"Can you talk?" he finally asked.</p>

<p>The strange creature turned its head to one side
and eyed him closely, but no sound came from its
lips.</p>

<p>"It must be an ape of some sort," mused the boy;
"but how did it become so tame?"</p>

<p>He slowly returned his automatic to its holster,
thinking in the meantime how he could dress the
creature's wound; but no sooner had his hand left
his weapon than the ape sprang at him with the
utmost fury. It landed on his shoulder, wound its
legs about his neck, and with its long arms made
a wild grab for the revolver.</p>

<p>Then began a strange and terrible struggle for
the possession of the weapon. Even as he fought
the beast, Billie realized that in some manner the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
ape had learned to fear firearms, but whether it
had ever learned to use them he could not venture
a guess. He felt certain if he could draw the weapon
and point it at the ape, it would at once cringe
in fear. What might happen if the ape should get
possession of it, he could only imagine.</p>

<p>For a youth of eighteen, there were few whom
Billie met that were his match physically, but this
diminutive man-animal held him as in a vise. Billie
exerted every ounce of his strength to free himself
from the terrible hold, while the ape fought
even more fiercely to retain its grip and to gain
possession of the weapon.</p>

<p>It was a weird and fearful struggle waged there
in the stillness of the tropical woodland&mdash;a stillness
broken only by the occasional wild scream of the
ape, or the hoarse breathing of the boy as he fought
to free himself from that horrible grasp.</p>

<p>The struggle must have lasted for two or three
minutes&mdash;to Billie it seemed hours&mdash;when by a
sudden wrench the lad managed to free his left
arm sufficiently to get the beast by the throat. For
an instant it loosed its hold on his right arm and
that act decided the battle.</p>

<p>Finding his right arm free, Billie seized his revolver
and without drawing it from the holster
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>At the sound of the shot, the ape uttered a plaintive
cry, relaxed its hold upon the lad and fell upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
its knees on the ground with its hands raised in
supplication as previously.</p>

<p>"I ought to shoot you," declared the lad between
his gasps for breath as he drew the weapon from its
holster and pointed it at the animal, "but I won't.
I'll take you with me and maybe I can sell you for
enough to pay me for the scare you've given me.
Now, march!"</p>

<p>He pointed with his finger down the track, but
the beast would not stir.</p>

<p>"Don't you intend to do what I tell you?"</p>

<p>The animal perked up his head and kept his eye
upon the revolver.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Billie as he drew a long
breath, "this is the limit. I can't make you mind
and I won't hurt you. I guess the only thing I can
do is to go and leave you."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, Billie turned and
started down the track, his revolver still in his hand.</p>

<p>He had not gone more than a dozen steps, before
he heard the soft pat-pat behind him, and on looking
back could see nothing but the waving grass to
indicate the whereabouts of his erstwhile assailant.</p>

<p>"So I am to be followed, am I? Well, all right."
Then, as an afterthought: "I wonder how I can
catch him when I want him. I wonder if this will
do," and he raised his weapon and pointed it toward
the moving grass.</p>

<p>With the same plaintive cry which Billie had come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to recognize as one of fear, the animal ran toward
him and sank to his knees.</p>

<p>Billie smiled.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old chap. As long as I know how
to handle you, why you can follow me right back
to the train."</p>

<p>Again he started down the track at a brisk walk,
it having just occurred to him that there might be
something doing at the other end of his journey.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later he reached the station at
Pitahaya where he had expected to find Adrian and
the three Mexicans awaiting him, but, as we know,
they had gone on to the scene of the wreck. Not
realizing just what had happened, but always on
the alert for the unexpected, Billie, therefore, began
an inspection of the station.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to discover that Pitahaya
was little more than a siding with a one-room building,
which was used as a freight house and a waiting
room. It did not even boast of a station master.</p>

<p>"There must be some reason for having a building
here," he mused. "There must be some sort
of a settlement around somewhere. But what's that
to me? I might as well be jogging along towards
Pachuca."</p>

<p>Then he bethought him of the ape, which he had
no mind to lose after his exciting experience. But
the animal was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could raise him with a shot," soliloquized
Billie.</p>

<p>He raised his weapon, which he still carried in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
his hand, and fired aimlessly, while he turned his
eyes in various directions, but there was nothing
to be seen.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he thought, "what's the difference?
He'd just be a nuisance anyway. I might as well
be trudging along."</p>

<p>He jumped off the station platform and proceeded
down the track, filling the magazine to his automatic
as he went. Then having finished the task,
he returned it to his holster and once more began
counting the ties.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, five, six&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bing! And a stone whistled by his head.</p>

<p>Billie turned, and as he did so a second stone
from the same source struck him on the temple,
and he fell to the ground.</p>

<p>A second later the ape sprang from a palm beside
the station and ran toward him, stopping every few
feet to see if the lad would rise.</p>

<p>When within a few feet of the prostrate lad the
animal made a leap and landed upon his body. In
another instant it had gained possession of Billie's
weapon, which it examined curiously for a moment,
ere it sprang away and stationed itself some two
rods distant, where it sat watching with the weapon
aimed directly at him.</p>

<p>For perhaps five minutes the two retained their
relative positions and then Billie began to regain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
consciousness. Several times he moved uneasily and
then he suddenly sat up and looked around.</p>

<p>"I wonder what happened," he finally thought,
and then he became conscious of a pain in his head.</p>

<p>He raised his hand to the aching spot and his
fingers encountered a big lump.</p>

<p>The truth came upon him like a flash. He dropped
his hand to his holster, and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>As he did so he caught sight of the ape and
found himself looking into the business end of his
own weapon.</p>

<p>With a yell he dropped to the ground as though
the expected had happened.</p>

<p>But when no shot followed, he began to regain
his wits and lay still trying to figure out once more
just how much the ape might know about the use
of the weapon.</p>

<p>He remembered the old saying that a gun was a
dangerous weapon without lock, stock or barrel,
because a man killed his wife with the ramrod;
and so he figured that an animal which had intelligence
enough to throw a stone and knock him senseless,
might have sense enough to fire a revolver.</p>

<p>"If I only knew something about his history," soliloquized
Billie, "I might be able to guess how much
he knew. But he is a perfect stranger to me. I
don't even know his name."</p>

<p>After several minutes and nothing had happened,
Billie decided to make some effort to get away.</p>

<p>"I might as well be shot as to be prisoner to an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
ape," he thought, and so he arose to a sitting posture
and surveyed the scene.</p>

<p>There sat the ape as before, with the automatic
pointed at Billie, but with a puzzled look upon its
face. When the lad finally arose, the ape appeared
still more puzzled and at length, turning the weapon
away from Billie, looked into the muzzle.</p>

<p>"That settles it," exclaimed Billie. "He doesn't
know how to fire it. I'll go and take it away from
him."</p>

<p>He started toward the animal, which at once
pointed the revolver in Billie's direction. There
came a sharp report and a bullet whizzed by the
boy's head.</p>

<p>"Worse and more of it," exclaimed Billie. "He
doesn't know how to use the thing, but he's liable
to shoot me as long as I stay in range. I'll just
make myself scarce."</p>

<p>Stooping down, he picked up a good-sized stone
and hurled it at the ape and then, without waiting
to see the result of his throw, jumped into the jungle
which lined both sides of the track, determined to
make a detour and if possible lose his unpleasant
companion.</p>

<p>He had not run far before he realized that the
ape was following, but this he did not mind. There
were plenty of trees between them, and he felt sure
he would soon be able to reach some sort of a habitation,
when he suddenly found himself on the edge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of a deep basin into which he plunged before he was
able to gain his equilibrium.</p>

<h3>THE ROSARIO VIEJO.</h3>


<p>To be suddenly pitched head-foremost down a
rocky declivity into a mass of prickly pear bushes
and other tropical brambles is by no means pleasant;
and as a result Billie was not in the best of
humor when he picked himself up and looked to
the top of the 60-foot embankment down which he
had slid.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder they wouldn't hang out a red
light when they dig a hole like this," he declared
angrily, "and not let a fellow most break his neck,
to say nothing of scratching his eyes out! This is
worse than a subway cave-in."</p>

<p>He pulled himself together and surveyed his
surroundings.</p>

<p>The basin looked very much like an old quarry&mdash;so
old that the shrubbery on the sides had grown
into good-sized trees, and the whole place was covered
with herbage of one sort or another. In one
corner of the excavation, which must have covered
some two acres, there was the ruin of an adobe
house, while near the center was a stone structure
made of four stone pillars about twenty feet apart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and roofed over with two huge stone slabs, set so
as to form a gable roof. Except for its size, it had
the appearance of the old-fashioned well houses,
which were once so common in New England.</p>

<p>"It's a tough-looking place, whatever it is," was
Billie's comment. "I wish the fellows were here."</p>

<p>And then for the first time in more than half an
hour Billie bethought him of his companions. His
strange experience with the ape had driven all other
thoughts out of his mind.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed aloud, "I wonder how
the fight with the bandits came out?"</p>

<p>Almost as in answer to his words, there appeared
upon the edge of the excavation into which he had
fallen, but upon the opposite side from that on
which he had taken his slide, ten horsemen, three
of whom carried across the pommel of their saddles
the bodies of three men. They halted and surveyed
the basin critically. Then, single file, they slowly
descended into the quarry.</p>

<p>Billie recognized them the minute he laid eyes
upon them. They were the remnant of the bandit
band, and the bodies carried across the pommels of
the saddles were three of their wounded companions.</p>

<p>"This is no place for me," commented Billie as
he kept himself well hidden behind a giant cactus.
"It reminds me of Ali Baba and the forty thieves.
I hope I have better luck than Ali Baba."</p>

<p>As though to carry out the trend of Billie's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
thoughts, the horsemen halted near the ruin of
the adobe house before mentioned and two of their
number dismounted and entered. A minute later
the rest of the band rode into the ruins and disappeared,
followed by the riderless horses of the two
dismounted men.</p>

<p>Billie rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I'm getting dippy," he muttered.
"Maybe that crack on the side of my head has made
me see things."</p>

<p>He sat down to think.</p>

<p>"If I only had some kind of a gun," he mused,
"I wouldn't feel so everlasting helpless. Confound
that ape! If I ever see him again I'll break his
neck."</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's thought: "I don't believe
the beast would give up the chase. He's likely to
show up at any minute. Something has to be done."</p>

<p>The boy scanned the edge of the embankment, if
perchance he might see anything of his persecutor.
There was nothing in sight and he decided to go
on a tour of inspection. As quietly as possible he
stole along the side of the excavation toward the
spot where the ruin stood, when once more he had
that sense of being watched.</p>

<p>Turning his head quickly, he saw the ape about
twenty paces to one side aiming the revolver at him.</p>

<p>Then Billie lost his temper.</p>

<p>"This thing has got to stop," he exclaimed. "I'll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
be doggoned if I'm going to stand for it any
longer."</p>

<p>He ran quickly toward the ape, and fell on his
knees as he had seen the ape do, and raised his
hands in supplication.</p>

<p>The animal quirked its head and fairly beamed
with pleasure as it slowly advanced and stood beside
him.</p>

<p>But its simian smile was quickly turned to surprise,
for like a flash Billie snatched the weapon
from its hand and aimed it at the animal's head.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you come with me."</p>

<p>The animal made no move.</p>

<p>"We'll see whether you will come or not," said
Billie, and stooping down he broke off a good-sized
sprout from a live oak. "Now, march!" and he
raised the whip.</p>

<p>It was the one thing needed. The beast had evidently
felt the touch of a whip before, for it raised
its arm and danced about as though going through
some circus maneuver.</p>

<p>"The first mystery is solved," laughed Billie.
"Now for the second one. Come on, Ab," unconsciously
naming his companion after the hero
of Stanley Waterloo's famous story.</p>

<p>The ape seemed to know what was wanted and
the two proceeded slowly and silently toward the
ruin.</p>

<p>"I've been in a whole lot of queer scrapes," mused
Billie as he crept along, "but this is surely the queerest&mdash;tramping
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
around with an ape to solve the disappearance
of ten cutthroats. I hope I wake up
pretty soon."</p>

<p>But it was no dream, as Billie was soon to discover.</p>

<p>Arriving at the ruined building, Billie crawled
along by the wall until he came directly under what
had once been a window. Then, after listening a
long time and hearing no sound, he ventured to raise
his head and peep in.</p>

<p>The old ruin was as empty as though there were
not a living person within fifty miles.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" gasped the boy. "What do you
think of that! Now I know I'm dreaming!"</p>

<p>He turned to the ape, waving his whip.</p>

<p>"Here you, Ab," he said, "go in there and see
what you can find."</p>

<p>He pointed to the window and the animal sprang
lightly in and a minute later perched itself on one
of the decaying rafters.</p>

<p>"If there were any one around, they would certainly
see Ab," reasoned Billie, "and would make
some noise about it. I guess it's safe to go in."</p>

<p>He crawled around to the door and entered.
There were the tracks of the horses, but the horses
had disappeared as completely as though they had
been swallowed up.</p>

<p>Billie called softly to Ab, who did not see fit to
obey until he waved his whip. Then the animal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sprang lightly to the ground. Billie showed him
the tracks.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose they went?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ab blinked his eyes and, for the first time since
Billie had become acquainted with him, made a noise
in his throat, much like the voice of a child.</p>

<p>Billie smiled in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've decided to become sociable," he
said, "What do you make of this? You look as
though you could think."</p>

<p>Ab blinked his eyes stupidly and then suddenly
became alert as though listening.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Billie, impressed by the ape's
attitude.</p>

<p>For a reply Ab sprang through the window and
made straight for the structure in the middle of the
quarry. In another instant he was on the roof.</p>

<p>Billie followed as fast as he could and as he
stepped beneath the roof started back in the utmost
amazement, for up through what looked like a huge
well there came the distinct sound of human voices.</p>

<p>For several seconds he stood as one in a spell and
then he started forward to peer into the well, but
on a second thought did not.</p>

<p>"I couldn't see anything if I did," he thought,
"but any one looking up could see me. I'll do better
by listening."</p>

<p>The words came to him almost as distinctly as
though he were in the same room with the speakers,
and there was no longer any doubt that the voices
were those of the Zapatistas who had attempted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
rob the train.</p>

<p>From their conversation Billie learned the outcome
of the fight, and he was greatly amused at the
attempt of the bandits to figure out who had betrayed
them. Each one had a different theory, but
all agreed that there must have been a traitor in
the band. It was all the lad could do to prevent
himself from calling out to them, just to see what
effect his words would have.</p>

<p>After discovering from the conversation that the
bandits felt themselves perfectly secure where they
were and that they were likely to stay there for
some time, he finally decided to get back to the railroad
and thence to Pachuca and give the alarm.</p>

<p>Acting upon the decision, he made his way across
the basin to where he had slid down the embankment
and slowly and laboriously climbed to the top, followed
by Ab.</p>

<p>Retracing his steps, he soon reached the railroad
and looking down the track toward Pachuca gave
a shout of delight as he saw his three chums approaching,
leading a fourth horse between them.</p>

<p>"Just in time," he said, as they drew near enough
to exchange greetings.</p>

<p>"Just in time for what?" queried the others as
one.</p>

<p>"To capture the bandits that you let escape."</p>

<p>"How do you know that we let any escape?"
asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"I'm a mind reader."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>The other three looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a fact," declared Billie. "I can tell you
all about the fight just as well as though I had been
there," and he proceeded to prove his words.</p>

<p>"Some one told you," said Adrian.</p>

<p>"Sure," laughed Billie, thoroughly enjoying the
perplexity of his companions. "My friend Ab.
Come here, old man, and be introduced," and Billie
waved his whip, which he still carried.</p>

<p>With a little cry the ape sprang to his side, an act
which only added to the amazement of the others.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Billie with mock gravity, "to
introduce my friend Mr. Ab from No-man's-land.
Ab, these are the rest of the Broncho Rider Boys.
How would you like to join the company?"</p>

<p>Ab scratched his ear and looked wise.</p>

<p>"Oh, come," interrupted Donald. "Tell us what's
up and what we must do to capture the rest of this
band of cutthroats."</p>

<p>Thinking that he had carried the joke far enough,
and realizing also that he might be wasting valuable
time, Billie related his adventure, describing the
place he had discovered.</p>

<p>"It is the Rosario viejo," said Pedro, as soon as
Billie had finished his story.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"An abandoned mine. It is called the old Rosario
to distinguish it from the new Rosario, which is
now one of the most valuable mines in this region.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
The station at Pitahaya was built especially to
serve it."</p>

<p>"I see," said Billie. "Where is the new mine?"</p>

<p>"Down there," and Pedro pointed to a trail leading
in the opposite direction. "It is just about as
far from the station on that side of the railroad
as the old Rosario is on this."</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better summon some assistance
from the mine workers?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"They may be in cahoots with the bandits,"
laughed Donald. "I have lost my confidence in
about every one in this bandit-ridden land."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you," said Pedro, "and I hope the
day will soon come when all this trouble will be
over."</p>

<p>"Then you agree with me that we should tackle
the bandits alone, do you?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"It is the only safe way."</p>

<p>"All right, then," exclaimed Billie. "Let's be off.
If we use a little strategy, I'm sure we shall succeed."</p>

<p>He turned to mount the horse, which a minute
before had been standing a few feet away, but it
was gone.</p>

<p>"Where's my horse?" he cried.</p>

<p>The others turned in surprise.</p>

<p>"It certainly was here a minute ago," declared
Adrian.</p>

<p>"Then it can't be very far away," insisted Donald.</p>

<p>"It's so far I can't see it," replied Billie.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" shouted Pedro, who had jumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
his mount across the track as soon as he heard Billie's
cry.</p>

<p>The others looked in the direction indicated, and
sure enough, there went the horse about a quarter
of a mile away on a dead run and on its back was
Billie's late acquaintance, Ab.</p>

<p>"By George," exclaimed Billie angrily as he
snatched a rifle from Donald's holster, "I've had
enough of that ape. I'll put a stop to his foolishness,"
and he leveled the rifle.</p>

<p>But ere he could press the trigger, there was a report
from another quarter and the horse and its
rider hit the dust.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>WHEN THE OLD WAS NEW.</h3>


<p>A cry of astonishment went up from the quartette
and then they stood silent to see what would
be the next move.</p>

<p>They did not have long to wait, for presently a
tall, gaunt figure strode out of the brambles some
yards from the fallen horse and uttered a hoarse
shout, upon which Ab sprang from the spot where
he had fallen and ran toward the newcomer, giving
vent to shrill cries as he ran.</p>

<p>"That must be his master," muttered Billie. "I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
glad I didn't shoot the little beggar."</p>

<p>"I'm more interested in the master than in the
monkey," said Donald. "He is evidently not a
Mexican. Who and what do you suppose he is?"</p>

<p>"An animal trainer from a circus," replied Adrian.</p>

<p>"There are no circuses in this part of the world,"
commented Billie.</p>

<p>"If he only had a hand organ instead of a gun,
I could place him," laughed Donald. "What do you
make out of him, Pedro?"</p>

<p>"It's a <i>saltimbanco</i>."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A man who goes about making people laugh."</p>

<p>"Oh!" from Adrian. "You mean a mountebank?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And this chap," ventured Billie, "isn't satisfied
with making a monkey of himself, but carries a
real one with him."</p>

<p>Pedro laughed. "That seems to be it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry he killed the horse," said Donald.
"We need him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he didn't," suggested Adrian. "Suppose
we ride over and see."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, the boys rode out
into the open, much to the newcomer's surprise and
consternation.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ors," he exclaimed, as he came running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
toward them, "I am sorry I had to hurt your horse;
but I couldn't lose my brother."</p>

<p>"Your what?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"My brother. My little brother. Could I, Ambrosio?"
and he patted the ape on the cheek.</p>

<p>"What do you call him?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"I call him Ambrosio because he is so sweet."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Billie. "I called him Ab, but
he ought to be named Diabolo. But how about the
horse?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have rendered him quite useless
for the present, Se&ntilde;or. I may have broken his leg."</p>

<p>An examination of the fallen animal revealed the
fact that while the leg was not splintered, it was so
badly injured that the animal was quite useless.</p>

<p>"Have you far to go, Se&ntilde;ors?" queried the mountebank.</p>

<p>"Only as far as the Rosario viejo for the present,"
answered Adrian. "After that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After that," interrupted Billie, "we may not
want to go anywhere."</p>

<p>The mountebank looked at Billie questioningly.</p>

<p>"That's what I mean," reiterated Billie. "We
are going there to capture a band of cutthroats, but
we may have a fight."</p>

<p>The man made a grimace, which was intended for
a smile.</p>

<p>"I understand. Can I be of any service?"</p>

<p>Donald eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You may have noticed how I stopped the runaway,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
he remarked.</p>

<p>"Very neatly."</p>

<p>"Sure," from Billie. "It was a short stop."</p>

<p>"I perceive that you are an American. I am
also a fan."</p>

<p>"What!" from the three Americans.</p>

<p>"True. I am even worse. I formerly shot the
pill in one of the bush leagues. I aspired to a place
in the box of one of the major league clubs, but
instead I joined the Madero revolution. I had all
the sport I wanted and finding my brother in this
forsaken land, I joined him as a public entertainer.
Shall we give you a sample of our performance?"</p>

<p>"Not now," from Donald. "Let's go and round
up this bunch of revolutionists first."</p>

<p>"But why?" queried the mountebank. "To-morrow
they may be the government."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other with an expression
that said as plainly as words: "True! We never
thought of that."</p>

<p>"Now, I have a better plan," continued the mountebank.
"Let's go and entertain the revolutionists.
Let's be neutral."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we are already belligerents," laughed
Adrian. "We have had one brush with them."</p>

<p>The mountebank heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you have declared war, we shall
have to fight to a finish, unless," with a grin, "we
can intrench."</p>

<p>"It is they who are intrenched," explained Billie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"They are at the bottom of the old mine, although
I don't know how they got there."</p>

<p>"So," laughed the mountebank. "Suppose we go
and find out."</p>

<p>Arrived at the shaft house, for that is what the
gable-roofed building was, the boys and their new-found
friend approached and listened to the sound
of voices which still arose to the top of the shaft.</p>

<p>Evidently considering themselves free and safe,
the bandits were preparing their evening meal, for
it was now well on toward sunset. They were singing
and joking as though they had not just lost
half or two-thirds their number.</p>

<p>From a few remarks made now and then, it appeared
that they proposed on the following day to
recruit the band up to its former strength.</p>

<p>"That is the thing we must prevent," declared
Donald.</p>

<p>"A very easy thing," said the mountebank, "if we
had enough provisions to remain here for twenty-four
hours, or more."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"Why, they will doubtless send out two or three
to do the recruiting. We can capture them as they
leave the ruins."</p>

<p>Billie glanced at the man from under his broad-rimmed
sombrero as he asked: "How did you know
they came out through the ruins?"</p>

<p>The mountebank smiled.</p>

<p>"Now, don't go to mistrusting me, young fellow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
for I'm on the level. But I've been in this place
before, and I know that the only way to where your
friends down there are camping is through the
ruins."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They are only about sixty feet below the
ground, in a chamber which was originally a gallery
in the mine. The shaft over which this house
is built is over two hundred feet deep."</p>

<p>"I'd like to explore it," remarked Adrian.</p>

<p>"Do you think you have the nerve?" and the
stranger bent upon him a penetrating gaze.</p>

<p>Billie laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Say, stranger," he finally said. "I guess you
never heard of the Broncho Rider Boys. We've
got the nerve to do anything that any other human
being dare do."</p>

<p>"Then we'll get rid of these bandits in short notice,"
declared the mountebank emphatically. "You
are just the chaps I have been looking for."</p>

<p>He leaned over the mouth of the shaft and gave
a shrill whistle.</p>

<p>In an instant all was silent below.</p>

<p>Half a minute later he repeated the whistle thrice.</p>

<p>There was a clatter below of arms and accoutrements.</p>

<p>"Over behind those big cactus with you, quick,"
was the next command. "If you insist on fighting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
these men later, you can. Now let's get rid of
them."</p>

<p>For just a moment the boys hesitated, but there
was something in the man's manner that seemed to
force obedience and they obeyed.</p>

<p>They were not a moment too soon, for they had
no more than secreted themselves than the back wall
of the ruin flew open and the men rode out. Of
those who had been at the mouth of the shaft only
a few moments before, only the mountebank with
his ape was in sight.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked one of the band, riding up
to him.</p>

<p>"Guard the track at the summit. Let no train
pass, even if you have to tear up the track."</p>

<p>"By whose order?"</p>

<p>The mountebank made a mysterious sign with
his left hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno!</i>" from the horseman. "Close up the
doors and care for the wounded," and putting spurs
to his horse, he led the bandits from the basin.</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of sight, the mountebank
summoned the boys to the shaft house by a
wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you'll have a chance to test
your nerve, and we must work rapidly to get where
we wish to go before dark."</p>

<p>He took from a crude knapsack which he wore
upon his shoulders a coil of cord about half the size
of a lead pencil, but evidently of much strength.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Then seizing the ape, he fastened one end of the
cord to the belt about the animal's body, and despite
its unwillingness to be thus treated began to lower it
into the shaft.</p>

<p>Totally unable to account for his actions, the boys
stood speechless, watching the operations.</p>

<p>After some minutes, the cord slackened.</p>

<p>"He's reached the bottom," was the information
vouchsafed. Then a moment later: "Help me to
pull him up, one of you."</p>

<p>Billie hastened to lend a hand and in a short time
the head of the ape appeared above the edge of the
shaft. In his hand he held one end of a good-sized
rope, which the mountebank took and tied around
one of the stone pillars which supported the roof.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, "we are ready to descend
into the old mine. Which one of you will go first?"</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other, but there was no
reply until Donald asked:</p>

<p>"Why should we go down at all?"</p>

<p>"Why," was the somewhat quizzical reply, "to
show your nerve."</p>

<p>"Unless there is some good reason other than
that, there are plenty of ways to show our nerve
without lowering ourselves to the bottom of an
old mine."</p>

<p>"There is a good reason," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then tell us. If it is good, there can be no objection."</p>

<p>"The object of this descent," said the stranger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
calmly, "is to see if we cannot solve the mystery of
the abandonment of the mine."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been down?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"Often."</p>

<p>"There is no foul gas at the bottom?"</p>

<p>"Not now, as you may see by the condition of
Ambrosio, who has been clear to the bottom."</p>

<p>"Then I am willing to be the first to descend;
but first I must know more about you than I do."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make? You will have
three friends here with me. They are all armed and
I can see they know how to use their weapons. I
cannot possibly harm you. I will be the third to
descend. I assure you that the descent and the ascent
are comparatively easy for athletic young chaps,
as the sides of the shaft are very uneven. By the
aid of this rope you can come up almost as easily
as you would climb a ladder. The adventure is well
worth your while."</p>

<p>"And you won't tell us who you are?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you. I am an American soldier
of fortune. My name, if that means anything
to you, is Francis Strong, and I have assumed this
character of a mountebank solely for the purpose
of going about the country without being molested.
What I hope to do, is of no interest to any one but
myself."</p>

<p>It was a straightforward statement and the boys
saw no reason to doubt its truthfulness.</p>

<p>"All right, then," exclaimed Billie. "Here goes!"</p>

<p>He grasped the rope and lowered himself over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the side. It was as Strong had said and in a very
few minutes he found himself at the bottom. He
could see nothing except the dim light at the mouth
of the shaft.</p>

<p>Giving the rope a vigorous shake, as had been
agreed upon, he saw another figure begin to descend,
and in a short time Pedro stood beside him. Strong
was next to descend, then came Ambrosio, and after
him Adrian and Donald in the order named&mdash;Donald
having determined to be the last, that he might
be sure that everything was safe above ground.</p>

<p>"I should have given you this," was Strong's
first remark upon alighting at Billie's side, and he
drew from his pocket an electric torch. "But it
slipped my mind."</p>

<p>"We all have them in our trunk in the City of
Mexico," replied Billie, "but I doubt if either of us
has one with him."</p>

<p>"This is sufficient, for I shall light some torches
I have prepared as soon as we are ready for our
work."</p>

<p>When Donald had descended, Strong led the way
through a lateral about thirty or forty feet, at the
end of which another vertical shaft had been sunk.
Around the mouth of this Strong had set a number
of torches, which he now proceeded to light. By
their glare it was possible to see part way down the
hole.</p>

<p>"The thing I hope to find," explained Strong, "is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
at the bottom of that hole, if it exists at all."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"I think I can best answer your question," was
the reply, "by reading you a translation of a paper
which is said to have been found in the shaft above,
where the bandits have made their rendezvous. How
it came into my possession, matters not. I believe
there are now enough of us here to prove or disprove
its truthfulness, unless some one has been
here before us."</p>

<p>Seating himself on a jutting boulder, Strong took
from his pocket a paper, which he read as follows
under the flickering torchlight:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>

<p>"Being about to leave this world, I desire to obtain
forgiveness for the great and only crime of my
life, hence this confession.</p>

<p>"There were five of us. Names do not matter.
They were my fellow workmen. We had been entrusted
with the output of the Rosario for the year
and had promised to guard it with our lives. We
heard the soldiers of Maximilian coming. We were
not enough to withstand them. We determined to
hide the treasure in the western shaft. We carried
it to the edge and threw it in. My four companions
went down to cover it over with dirt, which I
brought from the other shaft and gave them, shovel
by shovel. A mad idea seized me. If they were
dead, no one but I would know the hiding place of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the treasure. I would kill them; but how? I
glanced about. Great pieces of rock were on every
hand. Without stopping to consider the foulness
of the deed I rolled a huge piece to the mouth of
the shaft and pushed it in. There was a cry of
terror and I heard a voice call out to know what had
happened. I said a piece of rock had broken loose
and asked what damage it had done. Only one replied.
The others had been stricken down. Madly
I pushed over another rock and then another and
still another. Then there was silence and I fled.
The soldiers found me unconscious at the bottom of
the shaft. Ere I became conscious, Maximilian was
no more. When I returned hither, the mine had
been abandoned. Here I have lived for years alone
with my misery. Now I die. May God forgive me.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A FEARFUL EXPERIENCE.</h3>


<p>"Well?" queried Donald when Strong had finished
reading the paper, "what are we going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"We are going to find out, if we can, whether
Jos&eacute; Rodriguez told the truth, and if he did, whether
any one else has tried to prove it."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Pedro?" asked Billie,
indicating the opening at their feet.</p>

<p>"Exactly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you ever been down in it?" asked Adrian
of Strong.</p>

<p>"No! I did not feel equal to the task and I was
afraid to ask help of any of these cutthroats."</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Pedro?" asked Billie,
turning to the Mexican lad, who had made no comment
whatever.</p>

<p>"It's an old tale," was the reply, "this story of
the Rosario viejo. I have heard it many times and
I presume this shaft has been explored by every
prospector in this section. In my opinion it is a
huge hoax."</p>

<p>At Pedro's words, Strong's face became ashen.</p>

<p>"Are you telling the truth?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am. My father knows of several who
have searched the place and nothing has ever been
found."</p>

<p>Strong drew a long breath and passed his hand
over his face.</p>

<p>"I have believed it true," he finally said, "ever
since I first came into possession of this paper.
There is something about it that rings true and I
have counted upon finding sufficient wealth to enable
me to achieve a long cherished plan. If what
you say," turning to Pedro, "is true, my chance of
attaining my ambition is very slim."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir, but if I had known for certain
what your object was in coming down here I might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
have saved you the trouble. Isn't there any other
way you might obtain the money you wish?"</p>

<p>"If there is, I don't know it."</p>

<p>"Pedro may be right," spoke up Billie suddenly,
"but I am in favor of making an inspection of our
own, now that we are here. What do you say,
Don?"</p>

<p>"I'm with you." Then to Strong: "How are we
to get to the bottom?"</p>

<p>Strong reached over and from behind a nearby
boulder produced another bundle of rope.</p>

<p>"I had intended making a rope ladder," he said.</p>

<p>"All right, then," from Donald, "a rope ladder it
shall be."</p>

<p>The boys set to work and in the course of an
hour had made a rope ladder more than fifty feet
in length. Lowering it into the shaft, it seemed to
reach to the bottom and Billie started to go down,
but Strong prevented him.</p>

<p>"I shall go first," he said. "If there is any danger
from poisonous gas, or from reptiles, I shall take
the risk. You boys have parents and homes. I
have no one. If I should suffer any mishap, do not
attempt to rescue me. It would not be worth while."</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen," declared Adrian. "I have
a hunch and my hunches are usually right."</p>

<p>The rope having been properly fastened and
warded off the side by an ingenious arrangement of
several large rocks, Strong began his descent. In
his left hand he carried a flaming torch and Donald
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
leaned over the edge, looking down, with rifle
sighted, to fire upon any reptile which might be
brought to light by the torch's ruddy glare.</p>

<p>Step by step Strong went down, stopping every
now and then to hold his torch below him, if perchance
it might come into contact with fire damp or
any other noxious gas.</p>

<p>He had descended at least three-fourths of the
way, when, as he swung his torch below, he uttered
a cry that was almost a shriek and the torch fell
from his hand.</p>

<p>At the same instant Donald gave vent to a loud
exclamation and his rifle cracked.</p>

<p>"Hold on," he cried as he arose from the ground,
"as you value your life, don't lose your hold."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the others in one voice.</p>

<p>"Snakes! Dozens of them," replied Donald.
"Climb up, Strong, as fast as you can."</p>

<p>"All right," came a feeble reply, followed almost
immediately by a louder call of "Help!"</p>

<p>"Hold fast," called Donald. "I'm coming."</p>

<p>But before he could turn to step down the ladder,
a chattering figure sprang past him and shot down
the rope.</p>

<p>It was the ape. He had heard his master's call
and had gone to his assistance.</p>

<p>A moment later came a joyful cry that told as
plainly as words that Ambrosio had reached his master
in time.</p>

<p>"Are you all right now?" called Donald.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll be up in a minute. Good old boy,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the last remark evidently addressed to the ape.</p>

<p>When Strong's head appeared above the edge of
the shaft a couple of minutes later he was as pale as
a ghost and when he at length came into the full
light of the torches, it was seen that his hair was as
white as snow. The fright had completely changed
its color.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," he gasped as soon as he
was helped to his feet. "I wouldn't go down into
that place again for all the gold and silver in the
world."</p>

<p>"It was pretty rough for sure," admitted Donald.
"I just caught a glimpse as the torch fell among
them, but it was so quickly extinguished by the
wriggling mass I only shot once for fear of hitting
you."</p>

<p>"It was the darkness that frightened me," Strong
explained feebly. "If I hadn't let go my torch to
hold on with both hands, I don't think I would have
minded so much. But the darkness hid what was
below and it just seemed as though they were right
after me. I'd have been a goner sure if it hadn't
been for good old Ambrosio," and he laid his hand
affectionately on the ape's head.</p>

<p>"Do you think you'll be able to climb out of the
mine?" asked Billie as they reached the main shaft.</p>

<p>"Yes, with Ambrosio's aid; but I'm going out
first. I don't think I have nerve enough left right
now to be the last out."</p>

<p>The exit from the mine was much slower than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
descent had been, but in the course of an hour they
were all once more out under the stars.</p>

<p>"What about the bandits?" queried Billie.</p>

<p>"Take my advice," said Strong, "and let them
alone. This is none of your quarrel. If the Mexicans
want to fight among themselves, let them. It's
a family quarrel and you will only make matters
worse by interfering. The time may come when
these very men may prove your best friends."</p>

<p>"That's the advice I gave when we first discovered
them to-day. I wish now we had all followed
it."</p>

<p>"If we are not going to do anything," declared
Adrian, "the quicker we get out of here the better."</p>

<p>"I consider that more good advice," laughed Billie,
"especially as I am just reminded that I haven't
had a bite to eat since noon. But I have no horse."</p>

<p>"That's easily remedied," replied Strong.</p>

<p>He went into the old ruin and in a few minutes
returned with a very good animal, all saddled and
bridled.</p>

<p>"It will not be missed," he said. "Now ride for
your lives. Take the trail to the left and don't let
moonlight catch you within five miles of here."</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with us?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"No! I am better off here."</p>

<p>"How will you account for your white hair?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell them it is a charm. They'll believe it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and it will make me that much more valuable. Now
go!"</p>

<p>Without wasting more words the boys put spurs
to their horses and were soon out of the basin and
on their way to Pachuca.</p>

<p>"It seems like a year since we came down here,"
remarked Adrian to Billie as they galloped along.</p>

<p>"It sure does," was the reply as Billie rubbed his
stomach suggestively. "I'll never go out again as
long as I'm in this revolutionary republic without a
haversack full of grub."</p>

<p>"Who said grub?" called back Donald.</p>

<p>"What a question," laughed Adrian. "Who is it
that's always hungry? It's all he thinks about."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is, eh?" from Billie. "Well, I'm thinking
about something else now. There's the moon coming
up over the valley and we're not three miles from
the old Rosario. We'd better keep our eyes peeled
and see that our shooting irons are in shape. We
may have to fight our way home even yet."</p>

<p>As though to verify the prediction there appeared
at the moment the figure of a solitary horseman silhouetted
against the rising moon.</p>

<p>"You're a prophet of evil all right," said Adrian.
"Now what?"</p>

<p>"Just keep on riding."</p>

<p>"But that chap is right in our way."</p>

<p>"Then ride him down. He'll be worse scared than
we are."</p>

<p>The advice seemed good and the boys spurred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
forward.</p>

<p>"If you think he means us any harm," Donald
remarked, "I might take a shot at him."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he does."</p>

<p>Again Billie proved a good prophet as the rider
rode directly toward them, waving his hat in his
hand.</p>

<p>"It's Tony," exclaimed Pedro as the rider approached
a little nearer.</p>

<p>Tony was one of Gen. Sanchez' servants.</p>

<p>"Why, so it is," laughed Donald. "I suppose he
is out looking for us."</p>

<p>Which was exactly the case. The news of the
fight had reached Pachuca along with the part the
boys had played in saving the bullion, and Pedro's
father had heard it along with the others.</p>

<p>Later, word had been brought that one of the boys
was missing and the others had gone to look for
him. When none of them returned after all these
hours, Gen. Sanchez had organized a searching
party, of which Tony proved to be the advance
guard.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, several horsemen dashed up
and the boys were given a rousing reception.</p>

<p>"The <i>Jefe politico</i> is waiting to greet you," Tony
told the boys.</p>

<p>The jefe politico is the mayor.</p>

<p>Billie smiled broadly and once more rubbed his
stomach.</p>

<p>"This begins to look encouraging," he remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
to Pedro. "I think I can taste the good things
already."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the boys reached the city and
were given a cheer as they passed through the main
street and up to Gen. Sanchez' home, which was
located half a block from the plaza. And in another
ten minutes Billie was facing the mayor over a plate
of steaming soup, while a mozo stood at his back
waiting to serve the leg of a twenty-five pound turkey.
Raising his eyes from the table, he caught
sight of what was coming and gave Donald, who
sat next to him, a dig in the ribs with his elbow.</p>

<p>"How's this for a prophet of evil?" he asked.</p>

<p>Donald took a look at the great bird which was
rapidly falling into pieces under Gen. Sanchez' skillful
hand, and remarked with a wink:</p>

<p>"Great!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE INSULT TO THE FLAG.</h3>


<p>A week later, or, to be more exact, on April 10,
1914, the Broncho Rider Boys and their friend
Pedro were back in the City of Mexico. During the
two weeks they had been at Pachuca, many changes
had taken place and on the morning in question
they had just finished their coffee in the breakfast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
room when Guadalupe, Pedro's sister, brought in
the morning paper.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>Guadalupe glanced at the paper and hid it behind
her back without making any reply.</p>

<p>"Why, Sister!" exclaimed Pedro with all the dignity
of his sixteen years. "How can you be so
rude?"</p>

<p>"She's only joking," laughed Billie, who was always
found on Guadalupe's side when any argument
took place. "Come, tell us! What is it?"</p>

<p>Guadalupe shook her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't," she replied in a pained voice.</p>

<p>"Why not?" from Billie.</p>

<p>"It says we are going to have war with the United
States and I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," replied Billie. "Neither
does any one else."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Pedro sternly.</p>

<p>Slowly the girl handed her brother the paper.</p>

<p>He opened it and read.</p>

<p>"A party of American marines was arrested in
Tampico yesterday for landing on Mexican soil with
arms in their hands. They were marched through
the streets under a heavy guard and lodged in jail.
After a parley with the American Admiral, Mayo,
the commandant of the city finally released them
upon the assurance of the Admiral that it should not
occur again."</p>

<p>"Well, if it was only a mistake, that doesn't mean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
war," laughed Billie, but Donald's face took on a
more serious look.</p>

<p>"That isn't all," said Pedro.</p>

<p>"Well," from Billie, "let's have the rest of it."</p>

<p>"The American Admiral has now declared that
the men did not land on Mexican soil with arms in
their hands, but that they were in their boat at the
pier when arrested. He claims that they were taken
from under the American flag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" almost shouted Billie, springing to his
feet. "Taken from under the American flag?
Well, I'll bet that will mean war&mdash;unless," he added
after a brief pause, "Gen. Huerta apologizes."</p>

<p>"Why should he apologize?" asked Pedro.</p>

<p>"For insulting the American flag."</p>

<p>"That's what the American Admiral says," interrupted
Guadalupe, "and he threatens to fire on the
city."</p>

<p>"And I'll bet he'll do it," said Adrian.</p>

<p>"If he does we'll sink his ships," said Pedro.</p>

<p>"What with?" asked Billie sarcastically. "Why,
Admiral Mayo could blow Tampico out of the
water."</p>

<p>"If he does, the Mexicans will march on Washington,"
from Pedro.</p>

<p>"What?" from Donald. "March on Washington?
Why, Huerta can't hardly keep Carranza out of the
City of Mexico."</p>

<p>"But if your admiral fires on Tampico, Carranza
will help Gen. Huerta," declared Pedro.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" asked Adrian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it. We may have our little family troubles
down here in Mexico, but if the United States
should interfere, we'd all turn in and fight her."</p>

<p>Billie was about to reply when Gen. Sanchez entered
the room.</p>

<p>"I see you have been reading the news," he said
calmly.</p>

<p>"And discussing it too," said Donald.</p>

<p>"Which we had better not at present," replied
the General. "You boys are our guests and as long
as you are, you are our friends; but I am afraid
there is serious trouble coming and I think it will
be much better if you make arrangements at once to
return to the United States. As you know, I am not
a favorite with the present administration and I
might not be able to protect you."</p>

<p>"We can ask the protection of the American Ambassador,"
said Donald.</p>

<p>Gen. Sanchez smiled kindly.</p>

<p>"The American Ambassador may be asked to
leave."</p>

<p>The boys looked serious.</p>

<p>"Do you really think it is as bad as that?" asked
Adrian.</p>

<p>"I fear so. Later dispatches from Tampico state
that the American Admiral has demanded a salute
of twenty-one guns to the American flag. I know
Gen. Huerta well enough to know that he will never
order the salute."</p>

<p>"Then what will happen?" asked Donald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"No one can say. I understand that the American
government has placed the matter in the hands of
Admiral Fletcher, the ranking officer, who is in
charge of the Atlantic fleet off Vera Cruz."</p>

<p>"Do you think we should go at once?" queried
Billie.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it would be better. I will make
such arrangements as I can for your transportation
to Vera Cruz. In the meantime you had better go
and register yourselves at the United States Embassy.
I am never sure of Gen. Huerta."</p>

<p>Without further discussion the boys prepared to
take Gen. Sanchez' advice, and, donning their hats,
started for the embassy, leaving Pedro much chagrined
and Guadalupe in tears.</p>

<p>"I can't see why there has to be war!" she declared.
"Why can't men behave themselves?"</p>

<p>"What do girls know about war?" asked Pedro.</p>

<p>"They know it's terrible and takes their fathers
and brothers, that's what they know, and they wish
they didn't have to know that."</p>

<p>Pedro made no reply, but went to his room, where
he selected from among his most cherished belongings
a gift for each of his guests&mdash;three beautiful
opals&mdash;and laid them upon their respective suit
cases.</p>

<p>When the Broncho Rider Boys arrived at the embassy
they found a large crowd of Americans already
assembled. Word had been circulated that it
would be wise for all of them to leave Mexico and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
those who could were going, while many men whose
business detained them in Mexico were sending their
families. All had come to the embassy for information
and to register.</p>

<p>As a result it was late in the afternoon before
the boys returned to Gen. Sanchez' residence. But
late as they were, the general had not yet come in.
They went to their room and when they saw the
gifts which Pedro had laid on each valise, they could
not keep back the tears.</p>

<p>"Well, there's one thing," declared Billie as he
drew the back of his hand across his eyes, "we don't
have to fight Pedro, no matter what comes. I'm
going to hunt him up and tell him so."</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>It was some hours later when Gen. Sanchez returned
and announced that it would be impossible
for the boys to get transportation to Vera Cruz for
two or three days, as the track had been torn up in
the neighborhood of Cordoba, but that he had been
promised that they would be given safe conduct as
soon as the track was repaired.</p>

<p>It was three days later, therefore, before the boys
were able to leave, during which time they remained
in the house at Gen. Sanchez' request to avoid any
unpleasantness, which might make trouble for him.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th the boys bade good-bye
to their host and his family and were driven in
an automobile to the station. Already there were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
more than enough persons to fill four trains, and
the guards were permitting only those to board the
cars who had passes signed by the Mexican provost
marshal.</p>

<p>Thanks to Gen. Sanchez, our boys had been provided
with such passes, but they were not allowed to
take their rifles or revolvers aboard the train. They
had no more than found seats and made themselves
comfortable than the conductor shouted "Vamanos,"
and the train pulled slowly out of the shed.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Donald as they rolled slowly
along, "this is a pretty tough ending to a friendly
visit. I think I've seen about all I want of Mexico
for some time to come."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose will happen?" asked Billie.
"Do you think we'll really go to war with
Mexico unless Gen. Huerta orders the salute?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," was Donald's cautious reply. "I
hope not."</p>

<p>"And I hope we do!" exclaimed a somewhat
florid gentleman who sat in the seat ahead and who
had overheard the conversation. "I'd just like an
opportunity to come down here with an army and
wipe the whole nation off the earth."</p>

<p>Donald made no reply, but Adrian asked sympathetically:
"Have they treated you badly, sir?"</p>

<p>"Have they treated me badly? Well, I should
say so. They wouldn't let me out of my hotel for
two days and now they have refused to carry my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
trunk and made me leave it with the express company.
I guess they don't know who I am."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they do not, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll show them who I am as soon as I get
to Vera Cruz and can see Admiral Fletcher. He'll
know how to protect Americans!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he will, sir."</p>

<p>"And when the first marine lands, I want to be
right there with a rifle to help drive the Mexicans off
the earth."</p>

<p>"It would be wise not to say too much," whispered
Adrian. "I see that officer in the end of the
car has his eye on you. He may speak English."</p>

<p>"I don't care who hears me," said the florid man
angrily. "I mean it."</p>

<p>At the same moment a guard who had approached
from the other end of the car laid his hand upon the
angry man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"If the Se&ntilde;or is not satisfied," he said, "we shall
be pleased to send him back to the City of Mexico."</p>

<p>"Oh, no-no-no," was the stammering reply. "I
am very well satisfied. All I want is to get out of
the country."</p>

<p>"Let us hope there will be no trouble about that,"
was the polite response, and the florid man lapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Ordinarily it is a pleasant day's journey from the
City of Mexico to the seaport city of Vera Cruz; or
if one prefers he may make a night ride of it in
times of peace. The train which left the City of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" href="#Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Mexico that April morning made no such time.
After a tiresome all-day ride with numerous aggravating
stops, when darkness fell they were still
on the plateau of Mexico, some miles west of Orizaba,
running slowly for fear some stray bunch of
Carranzistas or Zapatistas might have torn up a
length or two of track.</p>

<p>It was possibly an hour later that the engine gave
a furious jerk, followed by a bump and another jerk,
and then the train came to a dead stop.</p>

<p>In a minute everybody was on his feet asking
everybody else what had happened. As no one
knew, there was a general movement for the doors,
as it was too dark to see much from the windows.</p>

<p>"Sit down, everybody," ordered the guard.
"There is no danger, but we have stopped on a high
trestle."</p>

<p>The passengers obeyed, realizing the danger of
leaving the coaches. There was a general round of
conversation, and then as the train did not start,
people settled back in their seats and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>Some minutes later Billie gave Adrian a nudge
with his elbow.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"I've just been looking out of the window. We're
not on a trestle."</p>

<p>"No? Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Only that the guard was lying. What did he do
it for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Because he was a Mexican, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
guess. Go on to sleep."</p>

<p>"That isn't the answer, although it's pretty good.
They have some scheme. I wouldn't be surprised if
they were going to keep us prisoners somewhere
around here."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Go on to sleep."</p>

<p>But Billie was not satisfied. He leaned over and
tried to talk to Donald, but he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go on a little scouting expedition,"
he muttered. "I need some exercise."</p>

<p>He arose, stretched himself and walked slowly
toward the door, which stood wide open.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the guard is?" he thought. "It's
mighty funny he'd go and leave the coach like this."</p>

<p>He stepped on to the coach ahead. The same condition
existed.</p>

<p>Billie's curiosity got the best of him and he
jumped out onto the ground. It was pitch dark, but
he had not advanced more than twenty steps before
he discovered groups of men seated upon the grass.
A second glance convinced him they were armed.</p>

<p>He drew back and stood beside the coach, where
he thought fast.</p>

<p>"There's one of two things," he soliloquized. "We
are either prisoners or else we are being guarded
against an expected attack. Whichever it is, this
is no time for the Broncho Rider Boys to be asleep.
I'll go and tell the others."</p>

<p>He started to climb onto the car, but a guard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
appeared on the platform and ordered him away at
the point of his bayonet.</p>

<p>"I'm a passenger," explained Billie.</p>

<p>"Go away!" was the reply, emphasized by a quick
advance of the bayonet.</p>

<p>Seeing that it was no time to argue, Billie slid
back into the darkness.</p>

<h3>TREACHERY FOILED.</h3>


<p>Broncho Billie had been in too many unpleasant
places to be at all worried over his predicament, but
he was much concerned about the condition of the
train and its passengers, practically all of whom were
Americans and a large majority of whom were
women and children.</p>

<p>"It would be fierce," he mused, "to have them
held here, or in a detention camp as prisoners; and
it would be worse if we should be attacked by an
overwhelming force of revolutionists. I've just got
to know the truth."</p>

<p>He glanced up at the coach with its dimly lighted
windows.</p>

<p>"I wish I could talk to old Don. He most always
knows what to do. But how can I get at him?"</p>

<p>He sneaked out to where he could see the coach
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" href="#Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
platform. The guard was still there, as well as the
guard on the other car.</p>

<p>"Worse and more of it," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then he examined the car, trying to determine
at which window he had been seated. Several were
open, and he determined to try and speak to some
one.</p>

<p>"Our seats are not far from here," he thought as
he stopped under the second one. "I'll try this."</p>

<p>He picked up a stone about as big as an egg and
tossed it into the window. A howl from a child
followed the act and Billie ducked under the car.
He could hear the mother pacifying it, but evidently
she, too, had been asleep and had not discovered the
stone.</p>

<p>"I think I know just which child it is," said Billie
with a grin, "and this next open window must be
ours."</p>

<p>He picked up another stone and tossed it in to his
second choice, this time with better results.</p>

<p>Donald had just aroused from a nap, and, missing
Billie, was looking for him. Not seeing him in the
car, he was about to look out of the window when
the stone hit him on the chin.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" he exclaimed as he started back.</p>

<p>Billie heard the exclamation and gave the familiar
whistle.</p>

<p>Donald was on the alert in an instant. Looking
up and down the car to be sure he was not being
watched, he stuck his head out of the window.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trouble," was Billie's laconic reply. "Come
out."</p>

<p>"How can I? The guard is at the door."</p>

<p>"Jump out of the window."</p>

<p>"They might see me."</p>

<p>Billie thought fast.</p>

<p>"Let Ad stand between you and the door."</p>

<p>"Great," from Donald.</p>

<p>He aroused Adrian and told him the situation.</p>

<p>"You stay in the train," he said, "and we'll keep
you posted as to what is going on outside. If there
is any real danger we will give the alarm."</p>

<p>He picked up his overcoat and pretended to be fixing
a pillow. Adrian did the same. Then, while
the guard's back was turned, he dropped out of the
window.</p>

<p>Billie was beside him when he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"This way, Don," he whispered. "Let's get out
into the dark and hold a council of war."</p>

<p>They glided out into darkness, but where they
could keep their eyes on the engine.</p>

<p>"Now tell me about it," said Don.</p>

<p>Billie told him what he had discovered.</p>

<p>"It does look strange," Donald admitted. "Have
you any plan?"</p>

<p>"I haven't an idea above an oyster," was the
characteristic reply.</p>

<p>Donald scratched his ear reflectively.</p>

<p>"How would it do," he finally asked, "to sneak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
over by the soldiers and see if we can't pick up some
scrap of conversation that may give us a clue as to
what is going on?"</p>

<p>"Fine. We must keep together, though. We
might never find each other in the dark if we should
become separated."</p>

<p>Silently they crawled toward the spot where Billie
had seen the soldiers. When they did not hear any
sign of them after several minutes' crawling they
stopped to listen.</p>

<p>"There surely was a squad here a few minutes
ago," declared Billie. "They must have moved."</p>

<p>They remained silently thoughtful for several
minutes, but all was as silent as a graveyard.</p>

<p>"That's mighty funny," said Billie. "I know I
was not mistaken. Let's go back by the train."</p>

<p>They turned for that purpose and could see a
group of figures at the platform of each coach.</p>

<p>"That's the answer," exclaimed Billie. "They
have surrounded the train. Now let's see what will
happen."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait as an officer shortly
boarded each car and a minute later there was a commotion
among the passengers.</p>

<p>Drawing a little nearer, the boys could hear the
officer in the car nearest them explaining that the
passengers would be obliged to alight and change
trains.</p>

<p>"The track has been torn up ahead of us," he said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
"and we shall have to walk nearly a mile to where
the train is that came up from Vera Cruz."</p>

<p>This had been quite the customary thing in Mexico
for some months and the passengers prepared to
obey.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it is true," said Billie to Donald.</p>

<p>"We can soon find out," declared Donald. "Let's
walk down the track a piece. We can easily keep
ahead of the crowd."</p>

<p>Avoiding the glare of the locomotive's headlight,
the boys hurried down the track and when far
enough away from the train to feel secure, they took
the middle of the track.</p>

<p>"This is far enough ahead," said Donald, "to keep
out of sight and the track is all right so far. I don't
believe it is torn up at all."</p>

<p>"Then what is up?"</p>

<p>"That is what I've been trying to decide for nearly
an hour," replied Billie. "It looks as though they
intended to make all the Americans prisoners."</p>

<p>"But what for?"</p>

<p>"Why, for hostages, to be sure. Don't you remember
how C&aelig;sar took a lot of the Helvetians for
hostages?"</p>

<p>"By George!" from Donald. "I believe you are
right. Do you suppose it is Huerta's orders?"</p>

<p>"I expect so. He hates Americans."</p>

<p>While the boys had been talking the passengers
had been taken from the train and were now coming
toward them.</p>

<p>"Let's keep just far enough ahead to see what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
will happen," said Donald. "We must get in touch
with Adrian somehow."</p>

<p>They started ahead, but it speedily developed that
the others were not following. Instead they had
been halted a short distance from the locomotive,
back from the track, and surrounded by soldiers.</p>

<p>"There seems to be a hitch somewhere," Don
finally remarked. "They don't seem to know just
what they do want to do."</p>

<p>"Come on back and find out," said Billie. "It's up
to us to do something."</p>

<p>Cautiously they crept back to where they could
hear the conversation among the passengers and the
questions they asked the guard. Some were laughing
and more were expressing indignation. A few
of the women were crying, but above all they could
hear the voice of the florid-faced man telling what
he would do as soon as he could get into touch with
Admiral Fletcher.</p>

<p>"Which won't be very soon, unless I'm mistaken,"
laughed Donald.</p>

<p>Presently some one began to whistle a popular air,
but in such a way that the boys recognized the well-known
whistle of Adrian.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" asked Billie. "Ad wants to
know what we are doing."</p>

<p>"He'll have to want for the present," said Don,
"but there go a couple of officers back to the train.
Let's follow them."</p>

<p>The boys darted into the shadow of the coaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" href="#Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and crept back only a few steps behind what proved
to be the captain in charge of the company and his
second lieutenant.</p>

<p>"If I only had my automatic, I'd soon settle this
whole matter," declared Billie.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't hurt anybody, would you?"</p>

<p>"I'd capture the officer and make him take us to
Vera Cruz."</p>

<p>"Of course," from Donald. "Why didn't I think
of it before? Let's do it."</p>

<p>"But we have no weapons."</p>

<p>"Then we must get some."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes open. There must be some way."</p>

<p>The officers kept on their way until they reached
the first Pullman, where they stopped for a minute.</p>

<p>"Are the orders in here?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"No; the conductor has them. He wouldn't stop
the train without I gave them to him."</p>

<p>"Carramba! Why didn't you tell me so before?
Go and take them from him and bring them here
at once."</p>

<p>"Bueno, Capitan! Will you wait here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go inside. Hurry."</p>

<p>The lieutenant turned and hurried back. The
boys only saved themselves from being detected by
throwing themselves flat on the ground.</p>

<p>For a moment the captain remained looking after
his companion and then turned and entered the car.</p>

<p>"We must have that order," said Donald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must!" echoed Billie.</p>

<p>"Then we'll get it," they exclaimed as one.</p>

<p>So alike were the thoughts that passed through
their minds that they did not even feel obliged to
speak the plan aloud.</p>

<p>"Which one of us will stop him?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"You'd better. I'm heavier and I can handle him
easier."</p>

<p>They walked back some ten feet, where Donald
stopped, while Billie went about ten feet farther and
drew off into the darkness.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later they heard the lieutenant
coming. He passed Billie without seeing him.</p>

<p>Then Donald advanced and met him as by chance.</p>

<p>"Who comes there?" asked the lieutenant in a
sharp tone, drawing his revolver.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, lieutenant," said Donald as he came
close to him. "What's happened?"</p>

<p>The lieutenant eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From the rear sleeper. I woke up and found
myself all alone."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted the lieutenant. "You must
have been overlooked. Come with me."</p>

<p>He started to replace his revolver in its holster
when a slight noise behind him caused him to turn
his head. As he did so, Billie's fist caught him under
the chin and he fell in a heap without making a
sound.</p>

<p>"Good work!" muttered Donald as he picked up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" href="#Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the revolver which the lieutenant had let fall. "Now
to business."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>DONALD'S STRATEGY.</h3>


<p>Lifting the unconscious man in their arms, they
bore him into the darkness away from the train,
where he was soon deprived of his coat, hat, and
weapons. Then he was gagged and securely tied
with his own sabretasche.</p>

<p>Donald, being nearest the lieutenant's size, donned
his uniform, buckled on his sword, and with the order
in his hand hastily entered the car, closely followed
by Billie, with the ready revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>The captain had thrown aside his hat and was
smoking a cigarette in one of the easy seats as the
boys entered. He gave them only a hasty glance as
he blew a cloud of smoke into the air, and the next
minute he was covered by Billie's weapon.</p>

<p>"Up with your hands!" was the stern order.</p>

<p>The captain hesitated, but a sharp prick from
Donald's sword sent the hands into the air.</p>

<p>In another minute the captain was disarmed.</p>

<p>"Now," said Donald sternly, "we'll see what all
this trouble is about."</p>

<p>He opened the telegram he held in his hand and
read:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"American Admiral has given an ultimatum.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Hold train and passengers until further orders.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 30.7em;"><p>
Maas."</p></div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Who is Maas?" asked Donald sternly.</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>"You'll answer in just one minute, or you'll never
have a chance to answer another question," said
Donald, as he stood with drawn sword, while Billie
covered the captain with his revolver.</p>

<p>"Would you murder an unarmed man?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't consider it murder. Answer."</p>

<p>The look in Donald's eyes was not to be mistaken.</p>

<p>"Gen. Maas is in command of Vera Cruz," the
captain said.</p>

<p>"Good. I think I see it all. If it is decided not
to accede to the ultimatum, it is proposed to hold the
train load as hostages."</p>

<p>The captain smiled.</p>

<p>"Now listen!" and Donald spoke very slowly so
that every word might find lodgment. "You have
one chance for your life. Can you guess what it
is?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"To do just exactly as I bid. Just one little attempt
to do differently, and you are a dead man."</p>

<p>The captain scowled, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Put on your hat and come with me. Order the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
passengers back on to the train and give your engineer
instructions to cover just as much of the distance
between here and Vera Cruz by daylight as he
knows how!"</p>

<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders as he arose
from his seat.</p>

<p>"I see you think it will be easy to escape. Just
put any such idea out of your mind. There is
no possible chance."</p>

<p>Donald turned to Billie.</p>

<p>"This is what must be done. We shall walk
directly back to where the passengers are. The captain
will give his order without any hesitation.
Otherwise I shall shoot him through my pocket.
You will keep right behind us. If I fire, you fire
also. One of us will be sure to kill him."</p>

<p>Donald led the way from the car and Billie
brought up the rear.</p>

<p>Through the dark they marched, each with a hand
on the captain, so they might feel his slightest
tremor.</p>

<p>Arriving at the engine the captain summoned the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"Order the passengers to board the train," was
the brief command.</p>

<p>The sergeant hastened to obey.</p>

<p>"Bueno!" said Donald, as the passengers rushed
back.</p>

<p>Then under his breath to Billie: "Call Adrian."</p>

<p>Billie did so.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" Adrian called back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Down near the engine."</p>

<p>A moment later Adrian appeared coming through
the crowd of hurrying passengers.</p>

<p>"Where's Don?" he asked as soon as he caught
sight of Billie.</p>

<p>"Not far. Stay here. We may need you."</p>

<p>Adrian's face showed some surprise, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>"Now, captain," said Don quietly, "your orders
to the engineer," and under cover of the darkness
he pushed the point of his revolver into the captain's
side, while Billie touched him significantly in the
back.</p>

<p>The captain gave the order as he had been instructed.</p>

<p>"Now for the conductor," ordered Donald.</p>

<p>The order was given, but the conductor refused
to obey.</p>

<p>"I must have a written order," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Donald, in his r&ocirc;le of lieutenant.</p>

<p>"To countermand the order of Gen. Maas."</p>

<p>"Captain," was Donald's quiet hint, "don't you
think it would be well to place the conductor under
arrest?" and again he poked his revolver into the
captain's side.</p>

<p>The order for the conductor's arrest was quickly
given.</p>

<p>"Now, then, vamose," called Adrian. Then to
the engineer, "I will act as conductor."</p>

<p>The guards and extra soldiers who had been detailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
for this special service, sprang aboard; the
engineer pulled open the throttle and the train began
to move.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going, too?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered Billie to Donald, "hurry aboard
with your prisoner."</p>

<p>The captain was evidently of the same mind, for
he started to board the already moving train.</p>

<p>"No you don't," exclaimed Donald, pulling him
back. "You're going to stay here with us!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean it, Don?" asked Billie in surprise.</p>

<p>"Sure! What do you think he'd do to us as soon
as it was light?"</p>

<p>By this time the train was under headway; a
second later the last coach passed them and in another
minute the tail lights were disappearing in the
darkness.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," remarked Adrian with a long
breath, "as though we were in the consomm&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," was Donald's laconic reply, "but
those women and children will be safe in Vera Cruz
under the guns of Admiral Fletcher's fleet by daylight,
or I'm greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>"And what are we going to do with our friend
the captain?" queried Billie.</p>

<p>"He'll have to accept our hospitality under the
stars until morning and then we'll see."</p>

<p>In telling about his experiences later Billie said it
was the longest and the shortest night he ever knew.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
It seemed a long time for daylight, but it seemed a
short time for the train which was bearing his countrymen
to safety.</p>

<p>When day finally began to break, the first thing
that became visible was the snow-tipped peak of Mt.
Orizaba, against which the sun threw his brilliant
rays long before he could be seen above the horizon.
It was a beautiful sight and the boys voiced their
admiration with many exclamations of delight.
Then they turned their attention to the more serious
thoughts for the day.</p>

<p>The first thing they did was to release the lieutenant
from his unpleasant predicament and restore
to him his uniform.</p>

<p>"We should like to return you your arms also,"
said Donald, "but your government took ours from
us and I think we shall have to keep yours in their
place."</p>

<p>Neither of the officers made any reply, but their
dark looks boded no good for the boys.</p>

<p>"You might just as well look pleasant," laughed
Billie. "All is fair in love and war."</p>

<p>"We'll make you sing a different song when we
get you in Vera Cruz," said the captain.</p>

<p>"And when do you think that will be, Captain?"
queried Adrian.</p>

<p>"As soon as the next train comes along."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" said Donald. "That being
the case, I guess we will not wait for another train.
By the way, how far is it to Vera Cruz?"</p>

<p>"About a hundred kilometers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" href="#Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's about eighty-four miles, isn't it, Ad?"</p>

<p>"Just about."</p>

<p>"And it's down hill pretty much all the way, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"I should say so by looking down the valley."</p>

<p>"A right nice little walk, Captain. Let's be going.
We ought to make it easily in four days."</p>

<p>At this cordial invitation the captain lost his temper.</p>

<p>"Carramba!" he exclaimed. "Am I a boy to be
made sport of? I will not go. If you wish me to
go you will have to carry me," and he deliberately
laid himself down on the ground.</p>

<p>In spite of themselves the boys were obliged to
laugh.</p>

<p>"We carried the lieutenant last night, but we don't
desire your company badly enough to carry you,"
laughed Billie. "If you don't want to go, I for one
vote to leave you. We have to forage for something
to eat and the fewer there are, the easier it will be.
And speaking of eats, it seems to me I smell something
cooking right now."</p>

<p>At Billie's words the others sniffed up their noses.</p>

<p>"It's a fact as sure as you're born," declared
Donald.</p>

<p>"And I'm going to find out where the odor comes
from," said Billie. "There must be a house around
here somewhere."</p>

<p>Again he sniffed the air and smiled jubilantly.</p>

<p>"The wind's in the east," he laughed. "It must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
be somewhere in this direction. Come on, Captain."</p>

<p>The captain refused to move, but Billie led the
way, followed by the two boys. They had not gone
many rods when through an opening in the trees
they beheld a good-sized adobe house. Pushing
hastily toward it, they soon reached a cleared space,
and there, gathered about a bunch of some forty or
fifty horses, were a dozen men, while through the
open door of the house many more were to be seen
seated at a table&mdash;eating.</p>

<p>"Come on!" exclaimed Billie. "I'm going to have
something to eat; I don't care who they are."</p>

<p>"We might as well make the best of it," declared
Donald. "We are discovered any way and the best
thing we can do is to put on a bold front."</p>

<p>Without further words the three boys walked
boldly toward the house.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>A TIMELY RESCUE.</h3>


<p>The minute the boys' presence became known,
there was a commotion in the house and in the clearing
surrounding it. Those in the yard sprang toward
their guns and those in the house jumped from
the table.</p>

<p>"Don't move," called out Billie. "We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
friends."</p>

<p>But the men were not sure and at once surrounded
the boys.</p>

<p>They appeared to be soldiers, but their uniforms
were of a great variety and many hues. Only the
officer in command had anything the appearance of
a real soldier.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded as he came forward.</p>

<p>"Friends! Americanos!" replied Donald.</p>

<p>"Yes; and hungry ones," added Billie with a gesture
that brought a smile to the officer's face.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?" was the next inquiry.</p>

<p>Donald explained that they had been left by a
train that had stopped nearby. He did not think it
necessary to enlighten the officer as to the circumstances.</p>

<p>"If you don't believe us," broke in Billie, "you can
ask the officers we left back there by the track."</p>

<p>Donald made a gesture of impatience, which Billie
failed to understand, but which the officer was quick
to interpret.</p>

<p>"Officers? Of which army?" he quickly asked.</p>

<p>"Gen. Huerta's."</p>

<p>"Carramba!" exclaimed the officer in command.
"Go quick, corporal, and bring them to me."</p>

<p>Then to Billie: "If you are telling me the truth
you have done me a great favor."</p>

<p>The boys looked surprised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"How is that?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Do you not know that we are of the army of
Gen. Carranza?" was the interrogative reply.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" exclaimed the boys in unison.</p>

<p>"It is true," said the officer. "I am Captain Lopez.
Now tell me, who are you?"</p>

<p>Briefly Donald told of their acquaintance with
Gen. Sanchez and of their adventures of the night
before, at which the captain laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"You are smart boys," he declared.</p>

<p>"And hungry ones," again added Billie.</p>

<p>"You must be. Here, Juan," calling a soldier to
him. "Take these <i>muchachos</i> to the house and feed
them. I'll have a look at these rebels."</p>

<p>"Rebels," said Adrian to Donald under his breath
as they walked toward the house. "Now what do
you think of that?"</p>

<p>"That's his viewpoint," replied Don. "He thinks
of the men who overthrew President Madero as
rebels."</p>

<p>By this time they were near enough the house for
Billie to smell the aroma of the coffee and he quickened
his pace.</p>

<p>"I'll talk politics after I've sampled the breakfast,"
he declared. "If the breakfast is good, I'll
join the band."</p>

<p>It was nearly half an hour later that the boys
stood before the captain. With a good breakfast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" href="#Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
under their belts they felt fit for anything that
might offer.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you boys are in a bad fix," said Captain
Lopez. "I suppose you want to get to Vera
Cruz and on to some ship that will take you to the
United States; but I don't know how you are going
to make it."</p>

<p>"Why, can't we get another train somewhere
down the line?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"There may not be any more trains for some
time."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"We are here to stop them."</p>

<p>"Does that mean you are going out to tear up the
track?"</p>

<p>"Not right here, but a little nearer Vera Cruz.
There is a much larger body of troops about five
miles below."</p>

<p>Billie uttered a prolonged whistle.</p>

<p>"That does look bad, sure enough," he declared.
Then, after a pause: "What's the matter with
walking?"</p>

<p>"It's a long ways and the mountains are full of
our men."</p>

<p>"Can't you give us a safe passage? You say we
have done you a favor by turning these two officers
over to you," suggested Donald, indicating with a
nod of his head the captain and lieutenant of the
train guard who were now held prisoners.</p>

<p>"I'll do the best I can," was the reply, "but you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
will have to remain with me to-day. We are on
scout duty and shall not return to the main body
until to-night."</p>

<p>"That'll suit me all right," laughed Billie, "and
if you don't mind I think I'll go into the house
somewhere and take a nap."</p>

<p>"Bueno," laughed the captain. "You might as
well all take a nap. If we have occasion to leave
the neighborhood we will call you."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the three were fast asleep on
a pile of Mexican blankets in the best room in the
house.</p>

<p>Three hours later they were awakened by a fusillade
of shots.</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet and looked around.
For just a moment they could not remember where
they were. Then they recalled their situation and
became on the alert.</p>

<p>"Trouble outside," was Don's laconic statement.</p>

<p>He and Billie drew the revolvers they had captured
the night before.</p>

<p>"Put 'em up," advised Adrian. "We're not here
to fight."</p>

<p>"We might have to," from Billie.</p>

<p>"Not at all. If one side wins, we are safe. If
the other side wins, we are prisoners and the attackers
will be our rescuers."</p>

<p>"Great head, Ad," was Billie's comment. "But
I'd like to know what is going on," as another
fusillade was heard.</p>

<p>"Better stay where we are till the shooting stops,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
said Don.</p>

<p>It was good advice and the boys waited as quietly
as they could.</p>

<p>A few minutes later there was a volley and a
shout, followed by the sound of rushing feet. Then
there was quiet as the shots were heard receding.</p>

<p>When none of their friends returned after a few
minutes, the boys ventured to the door. There was
no one in sight.</p>

<p>"I wonder where they have all gone?" ventured
Billie.</p>

<p>"I expect that our friends have run away and
some of Huerta's soldiers are chasing them."</p>

<p>"If they do, they will run into an ambush," said
Adrian.</p>

<p>Which is exactly what happened.</p>

<p>"That won't do us any good," said Don. "Now
that we are alone, I vote that we get back to the
railroad track. We won't get lost if we follow that
and a train may come along."</p>

<p>The advice seemed good and they started to go.</p>

<p>"Hold on," exclaimed Billie. "Let's see if we
can't find some grub to take with us."</p>

<p>"Great head!" laughed Adrian.</p>

<p>"Great stomach, you mean," from Donald. "It
never lets him forget."</p>

<p>The boys plundered through the house. The
owners must have been scared away, for nothing
had been disturbed. In the kitchen they found a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
big plate of <i>tortillas</i>, half a baked kid, and some
wheat bread. This they appropriated.</p>

<p>"We might as well have a blanket apiece," said
Donald. "It is only another case of a fair exchange.
The Mexicans have our suit cases."</p>

<p>Each took a blanket and Adrian was so fortunate
after searching all over the house as to find a shotgun
and a belt full of loaded shells that went with it.</p>

<p>"If those shells were loaded with buckshot you'd
be all right," said Billie. "They're the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His speech was interrupted by a cry that fairly
made their blood run cold.</p>

<p>"What's that?" and the three stopped as though
they had been paralysed.</p>

<p>Again came the cry, and with a single bound the
boys were out in the open, each with his weapon
ready for instant use.</p>

<p>They could see no one, but there was the sound
of something crashing through the brush which hid
the railroad from the house.</p>

<p>"Sounded like a wild cat," declared Donald.</p>

<p>"Or a coyote," said Billie.</p>

<p>"I'm sure it was a human voice," remarked
Adrian. "Do you remember the Zu&ntilde;is?" referring
to another adventure told in the story of the
"Broncho Rider Boys Along the Border."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke there emerged from the brush
the figure of a woman carrying in her arms a small
child. Winged by fear, she was bounding along like
an antelope.</p>

<p>A moment later, and not two rods behind her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
came forth a figure which the boys instantly recognized
as a mountain lion.</p>

<p>How the woman had succeeded in escaping it
even for a moment was a mystery.</p>

<p>In a second the three weapons spoke. The report
was followed by a scream from the beast and
a cry from the woman, both of whom fell lifeless
to the earth&mdash;the beast dead and the woman in a
swoon.</p>

<p>"Take care of the woman, you two," said Adrian.
"I'll examine the beast."</p>

<p>No one stopped to question the order.</p>

<p>Billie picked up the child which the woman had
let fall, while Donald stooped down and felt the
woman's pulse. Then he darted into the house and
was back in a minute with a bucket half filled with
water. With it he bathed the woman's temples and
poured a little down her throat.</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes she revived and looked
around.</p>

<p>"Mi ni&ntilde;a!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"She's asking for her child," said Donald.</p>

<p>Billie carried the little one over and stood it
beside her.</p>

<p>With a glad cry she snatched it in her arms
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"She's all right," laughed Donald. "Now let's
have a look at that animal."</p>

<p>They walked over to where Adrian was watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" href="#Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the inanimate carcass.</p>

<p>"Where did we hit him?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"I can see three places and one is big enough to
throw a baseball through it."</p>

<p>"That's from the shotgun," said Donald. "It's
what did the business. Must have been buckshot
and we were so close it didn't have a chance to
scatter."</p>

<p>"I'd sure like that hide," said Adrian.</p>

<p>"We'll be in luck if we save our own," remarked
Billie. "Unless we can do something for the woman,
we'd better be jogging along."</p>

<p>By this time the woman had risen to her feet and
the boys could see that she was not a peon as they
had supposed, but of the better class.</p>

<p>"Where could she have come from?" queried
Donald under his breath.</p>

<p>"Suppose you ask her," laughed Adrian.</p>

<p>Donald did so. At first she was too dazed to
answer, but after Donald spoke a few words quietly
and in his very best Spanish, she was able to answer
his questions.</p>

<p>"Is this your house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, Se&ntilde;or; my house is down the mountain."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here alone?"</p>

<p>She gave him a startled glance and then hugged
the child closer to her breast.</p>

<p>"You need not fear us," were the reassuring
words.</p>

<p>"The soldiers came," she said slowly. "They had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
already killed the others. They would have killed
me."</p>

<p>"The soldiers?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They were looking for my husband. They
said he was hidden in the house; but he was not.
He is with Gen. Carranza."</p>

<p>"When was this?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday. I have been in the mountains all
night. There was a fight a few minutes ago and I
saw them pass. Then I came here, when the awful
beast sprang out," and again she drew the child to
her.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or!"</p>

<p>It was the child that answered.</p>

<p>In an instant Billie's hand was in his pack and
he held out the <i>tortillas</i>, which both mother and
child took and ate ravenously.</p>

<p>After their hunger had been appeased, they questioned
the woman further, telling her they were going
to Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>"If you will come with me down the mountain,
you can hide in my house," she said.</p>

<p>"We don't want to hide," laughed Billie. "We
want to get to Vera Cruz. However, we'll see you
home, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>Without more words the woman led the way,
Billie insisting upon carrying the little girl.</p>

<p>After a walk of more than two hours, the woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
stopped in a little clearing from which a view of the
mountainside for miles could be gained.</p>

<p>"There is my house," she said, pointing to the
roof of a really noble mansion constructed of stone.
"But what is that flag I see on top of it?"</p>

<p>The boys took one good look at it and then they
let out a wild yell.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" they cried. "It's the Stars and
Stripes."</p>

<p>"I don't know what it means away out here," said
Donald, "but wherever it is it means something.
Come on!" and he dashed down the mountainside,
followed by the others.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>FRIENDS IN DISTRESS.</h3>


<p>Half an hour later the boys stopped beside a
ruined wall in which was a still more ruined gate.</p>

<p>It was the home of Gen. Luiz Blanco, whose wife
and child it was that the boys had saved from the
mountain lion.</p>

<p>Above the house, on a lofty turret, waved the
American flag&mdash;a fact which caused the boys to
enter the gate and approach the house without hesitation.</p>

<p>But when they reached the great front door leading
into the patio, they found it shut and barred.</p>

<p>Here they knocked loudly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>For some minutes there was no reply, despite
repeated knocks, but finally a voice called out in
English:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"American boys in trouble."</p>

<p>"What?" was the surprised reply. "Say it again,
till I see if it is true."</p>

<p>"It's true all right, all right," said Billie. "If
you don't believe it we'll sing the 'Star Spangled
Banner,' or 'Hail Columbia'."</p>

<p>They could hear some one removing the bars and
a moment later the gate swung open, and a huge,
bewhiskered man in ragged garments and a Winchester
rifle in his hand stood before them.</p>

<p>"Come in quick," he commanded, "and let's get
this gate barred. There is no knowing when that
band of robbers will be back."</p>

<p>"Robbers?" queried Billie, as he set the little girl
on the ground and extended his hand to the man.
"What robbers?"</p>

<p>"They call themselves soldiers," and the man
seized Billie's hand and gave it a mighty grip, which
made even Broncho Billie wince, "but what do we
care for them? With four Americans we can defy
a hundred of them." Then, as Donald and Adrian
finished barring the gate: "It's certainly good for
sore eyes to see such faces," and he grasped each
boy in turn.</p>

<p>"Well, we're mighty glad to see you," replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" href="#Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Donald. "We expected to find the place deserted."</p>

<p>"How did you know anything about the place?"</p>

<p>"This lady told us it is her home."</p>

<p>"What?" from the man. "Do you mean to tell
me this is the Se&ntilde;ora Blanco?"</p>

<p>"Even so, Se&ntilde;or," replied the lady. "No one
would recognize me in these rags and grief. Oh,
Se&ntilde;or, had it not been for these brave Americans I
should have been devoured by a lion."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me. But I'd know they were the
real thing. Their faces show it. But come, let's go
into the house. You'll excuse me, Se&ntilde;ora, for taking
possession of your castle."</p>

<p>"It is yours, Se&ntilde;or. Do with it as you will. But
will you not do me the favor of your name?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Se&ntilde;ora. I had forgotten. I
am Ebenezer Black, who owns the ranch across the
valley. My daughter and I were out on a hunt for
some lost cattle when we were waylaid by this so-called
company of soldiers. I drove them off but
my daughter was wounded and I made for this
place. Finding no one at home, I took possession."</p>

<p>"I am so glad, Se&ntilde;or. And where is your daughter
now?"</p>

<p>"Sitting in a big armchair, nursing a wounded
arm."</p>

<p>"Oh, let us hasten," cried the se&ntilde;ora. "I may be
of some assistance."</p>

<p>They hurried into the house and into the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" href="#Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
library, now all in disorder and strewn with bits of
cigars and cigarettes. In one of the big leather
chairs sat a girl of some sixteen or seventeen, with
her left arm in a sling, but in her right hand she
held a glistening revolver. She was very slight, but
dressed in a riding costume of unique design, and
with a wealth of soft brown hair hanging just to
her collar. With just a touch of pallor due to the
wound, the boys thought her the most beautiful girl
they had ever seen, not excepting Pedro's sister
Guadalupe.</p>

<p>That the girl was surprised at the addition to the
party goes without saying. She looked first at her
father, then at the newcomers and then back to her
father, as much as to ask: "Who are they?"</p>

<p>"This," said Mr. Black as the se&ntilde;ora came forward,
"is the lady of the house and her daughter.
These are American boys, as you can see, although
you haven't had a chance to know many American
boys. I don't know their names, but names don't
count. I'll vouch for them."</p>

<p>"We are very highly complimented," laughed
Donald, "but I shall be pleased to introduce us. I
am Donald Mackay. Now that you know me, I
will introduce my friends, Adrian Sherwood, ranch
owner and good fellow, and William Stonewall
Jackson Winkle, better known as 'Broncho Billie.'
We are known as the Broncho Rider Boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father," exclaimed the girl, "I've read
about them. I have a book some one sent me from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the United States telling about their adventures at
the Keystone ranch."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," from her father. "I didn't
know they were such celebrities. Such being the
case, young gentlemen, allow me to introduce my
daughter, Josephine, commonly called Josie. Now
then, how did you all come here?"</p>

<p>As briefly as possible Adrian related their adventures
since they left the City of Mexico the previous
morning; told about the information contained in
the telegram from Gen. Maas, and wound up by
saying: "We may be at war with Mexico right
now for all we know."</p>

<p>"Well, now what do you think of that?" exclaimed
Mr. Black. "I just knew I had a reason
when I hoisted that flag. It's one Josie always carries
in her saddle bags. It makes her feel safer, she
says."</p>

<p>"And I hope she is safer," exclaimed Billie, "with
it waving over her to-day, than she would be without
it."</p>

<p>"At any rate she has more protection than she
had a few hours ago," ventured the se&ntilde;ora. "I
shall never forget how I was protected."</p>

<p>"I'd feel a whole lot better," said Donald, "if I
had some other weapon. A Colt does very well in
a tight place; but I certainly miss my Marlin."</p>

<p>"We formerly had quite a supply of arms," was
the explanation offered by the se&ntilde;ora, "but when
Gen. Blanco went to join Gen. Carranza he armed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
all his men and it took about everything we had.
However, there are a few weapons left&mdash;unless,"
she added as an afterthought, "the Huerta soldiers
have discovered their hiding place."</p>

<p>She led the way to the cellar and pointed to a
spot at one side.</p>

<p>"If you will brush away the dirt that covers the
floor about there," she said, "you will find a large
slab. This can be raised, and underneath there
should still be several good rifles."</p>

<p>Donald and Billie, who had accompanied her,
while Adrian remained up stairs with the others,
quickly followed her instructions. The edges of
the slab were exposed to view and after some effort
the opening was revealed. In it were four rifles
and an old-fashioned cannon. The rifles were not
of the latest make, but two were magazine rifles
and were a decided improvement over revolvers in
case it came to defending the house.</p>

<p>"I suppose that old cannon might be mounted on
the roof somehow and made effective," said Donald
after he and Billie had inspected the other arms.
Then to the se&ntilde;ora: "Is there any ammunition?"</p>

<p>"There was powder in that wine cask," she replied,
"but I don't know whether there is any left.
The balls for the cannon are on the roof."</p>

<p>The boys examined the cask and found it contained
quite a quantity of powder. Then they all
returned to the library and made their report.</p>

<p>"Not a very heavy armament to withstand a siege,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
is it?" was Mr. Black's comment. "Half a dozen
rifles with about a hundred cartridges, an old cannon
that might explode any minute, and four revolvers.
It won't do."</p>

<p>"What else can we do?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"Why, now that there are four of us, we'll cross
the valley to my house. It is just as well located
to withstand a siege as this and it is thoroughly
armed and provisioned."</p>

<p>"Suppose we have to fight?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll fight."</p>

<p>"But you forget your daughter and the se&ntilde;ora
and her child."</p>

<p>"I didn't forget Josie," was the reply, "and,
wounded as she is, she can take care of herself; but
I don't know about the others. They would be a
handicap. Have you anything better to offer?"</p>

<p>Billie scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Not for the moment."</p>

<p>"Well, I have," exclaimed Adrian.</p>

<p>"I thought it was about time Ad woke up,"
laughed Donald. "Let's have it."</p>

<p>"Captain Lopez told us that there was a large
body of Carranza's troops down the railroad a short
distance. If he meant by a short distance six or
eight miles they can not be more than a couple of
miles from where we now are. I feel sure that the
skirmish we passed through has proved disastrous
to the Huerta forces and I am willing to go out and
find Captain Lopez and bring relief."</p>

<p>"And I'll go with you," said Billie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can do just as well alone. If I am not captured
by the other side I shall make it easily, and,"
he added, "I am sure I shall not be captured, for I
can lick any squad of peons that I'm likely to meet."</p>

<p>"You are a brave boy," said Josie, a bit of praise
which brought the color to Adrian's cheeks and was
an added incentive for bravery.</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't I go?" insisted Billie.</p>

<p>"You may be needed here. This house is a
marked place and if a small band of the Huerta
forces has escaped, this will be one of the places
where they will rally."</p>

<p>"Your friend is right," agreed Mr. Black. "I
admire the pluck of all of you, but his plan is best.
The sooner he goes the better and we will make the
house as impregnable as we can. Let us hope he is
successful."</p>

<p>"You can bet on me," was Adrian's reply as he
shouldered his rifle, looked to the fastening of his
belt, and descended to the gate, where Mr. Black
let him out.</p>

<p>After Adrian had gone the others inspected the
house and its approaches for the purpose of determining
where they might mount the cannon. They
finally decided upon a spot in an angle of the roof,
where a chimney offered some protection and from
which it commanded the main approach to the
house.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure we will be able to get the cannon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
up there," laughed Billie as they passed through the
library on their way to the cellar, "but we'll do the
best we can."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," was Josie's reply. "You don't
know how strong Dad is."</p>

<p>The boys thought they could guess, but when they
saw Mr. Black pick up the cannon as though it had
been a log of cord wood and carry it upstairs they
concluded that Josie was right.</p>

<p>"When I was a young man," was Mr. Black's only
comment, "I was considered the strongest man in
our county. I reckon if it came to a pinch I'd be a
pretty hard man to handle even yet."</p>

<p>The boys had no doubt of it.</p>

<p>By the time the cannon was mounted and loaded
the sun was nearing the top of the mountains behind
them and a few minutes later it sank from sight.</p>

<p>"It won't be long now until we shall have to
depend upon our ears instead of our eyes for our
protection," said Donald. "Where is the best place
to watch?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I think," said Billie. "Let one
watch from the roof and the other down by the gate.
The one on the roof can hear noises from a distance.
The one by the gate can hear any one who
may be sneaking around."</p>

<p>"I'll watch on the roof," said the se&ntilde;ora. "I know
the chirp of every bird that belongs here. I shall
know in a minute if anything happens that is unusual."</p>

<p>"And I'll watch by the gate," declared Donald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" href="#Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only till midnight," said Billie, "when I'll relieve
you."</p>

<p>"And I'll relieve the se&ntilde;ora," said Josie.</p>

<p>"Where do I come in?" queried Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"You are the general, Dad. You can be everywhere."</p>

<p>Sentry duty is always nerve-racking business. If
you have ever been obliged to sit alone in the dark
and watch with your ears, you will understand
this and you will understand how Donald felt
sitting alone by the barred gate in the dark,
3,000 miles from home and in the midst of a
war-stricken country.</p>

<p>Even the north star looked unfamiliar, so close
was it to the northern horizon. Once in a while he
fancied he could hear the se&ntilde;ora weeping, but for at
least three hours this was all he heard.</p>

<p>Then he heard a distinct "S-s-s-s," which was
the signal agreed upon between him and the se&ntilde;ora
if she heard anything unusual.</p>

<p>In an instant he was on the alert. Yes, he was
sure he heard footsteps near the gate, without. Then
there were some minutes of silence, then the hiss of
a fuse and a moment later an explosion which blew
the gate from its hinges.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT ATTACK.</h3>


<p>Realizing in an instant that the hiss of the fuse,
like the rattle of the snake, betokened danger, Donald
drew hastily back into the patio in time to be
out of reach of the explosion which splintered the
gate and tore it from its hinges.</p>

<p>Then, with finger on trigger, he awaited the coming
of the foe.</p>

<p>It was a tense moment and the boy's heart beat
fast. He had been in many trying situations, but
never in one where the safety of so many others
seemed to depend upon him.</p>

<p>He heard the sound of oncoming feet and intuitively
threw himself upon the ground behind a
little stone paling which surrounded a dismantled
fountain.</p>

<p>The act undoubtedly saved his life, for an instant
later there was a scattering volley and he could
hear the bullets hit against the stone wall of the
house behind him.</p>

<p>In an instant he pressed the trigger and a yell
which followed gave evidence that the bullet found
a mark.</p>

<p>He fired again, but evidently without effect, and a
minute later a light at one side of the patio told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
him that the enemy, or a part of them at least, were
inside the gate.</p>

<p>As the light flared up Donald fired again, but
again without avail; but a moment later the cannon
on the roof spoke.</p>

<p>"So," he thought, "Billie and Mr. Black are at
last awake."</p>

<p>At the report of the cannon the light went out and
there was the rush of scurrying feet, followed by
a shout.</p>

<p>The shout indicated that those within the patio
had withdrawn to the other side of the gate.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that the patio was now free of the
enemy for a time at least, Donald retreated in the
dark to the house and was soon inside. At the first
landing he encountered Josie, sitting on a step with
a ready revolver. He was able to see her by the
dim light of an oil lamp which hung from the
ceiling.</p>

<p>"Where are the others?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On the roof. They are trying to locate the
enemy."</p>

<p>Donald ascended to the roof.</p>

<p>"I have a plan," he said, "which will enable us to
get in another shot. Load with shrapnel and I will
see if I can't make some sort of a light outside the
gate. Be ready on the instant."</p>

<p>He ran downstairs and again crept out into the
dark patio. He had noticed in the afternoon that
there were several bundles of straw in the stable.</p>

<p>Taking one of these under his arm, he approached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the angle in the wall near the outer gate. He lighted
a match and as the flame caught the straw he flung
the bundle over the wall, at the same time darting
inside the stable.</p>

<p>He had hardly found a safe position when the
cannon spoke again and evidently with telling effect.</p>

<p>But before those inside the walls had time to
think, the enemy rushed in, determined to capture
the place.</p>

<p>In the dark they rushed to the house, but once
under the gallery which extended all around the
inside of the patio, they produced a light which
enabled them to find the doors.</p>

<p>The light also enabled Donald to see those at the
door and he fired from the stable.</p>

<p>For a moment the fire in the rear disconcerted
the enemy and several fled, but others took possession
of the doorway and forced their way in.</p>

<p>The first one who entered fell by a bullet from
Josie's revolver; but realizing her weakness she
jumped and fled to the floor above, where she met
her father coming down.</p>

<p>"They have gained possession of the house," Mr.
Black told Billie as he and the se&ntilde;ora also descended
from the roof. "We must now guard the stairway.
We should be able to hold it indefinitely."</p>

<p>This prediction seemed correct, as the first four
or five men who attempted to reach the second
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
story never got more than their heads above the
floor.</p>

<p>After several trials of this sort, they withdrew
and held a council of war. The result was that a
few minutes later a voice called out from below:</p>

<p>"If you will surrender, your lives will be spared."</p>

<p>In reply Mr. Black shouted: "If you do not
withdraw and leave us in peace you will meet a fearful
punishment."</p>

<p>His reply was greeted with jeers.</p>

<p>"I wonder how many of them there are?" queried
Billie.</p>

<p>"Quite a bunch from the sound." Then, a moment
later, "They seem to be going out."</p>

<p>"Maybe they think we will come down," said
Josie.</p>

<p>"But we must not," exclaimed the se&ntilde;ora. "They
would kill us. Surely our friend must bring us
aid soon."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so," was Mr. Black's reply.</p>

<p>And hope was the best they could do.</p>

<p>There was no further attack, although they could
hear the sound of voices in the patio below.</p>

<p>After a long period of quiet Mr. Black ventured
the assertion that they were waiting for daylight,
and his surmise proved correct.</p>

<p>No attempt was made to force an entrance until
the first faint light of day began to appear. Then
there was renewed activity below and a few minutes
later the sound of a single shot.</p>

<p>"I wonder what that was," exclaimed Billie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>No one could answer, but had Billie been where he
could see, he would have known that it was Donald
who fired.</p>

<p>As the light came, Donald, peering through a
crack in the stable, had seen a man climbing up the
side of the house toward the roof. Without a
moment's hesitation he fired and the man dropped,
shot through the right hand.</p>

<p>But the shot was Donald's undoing. The flash of
his gun was detected and half a dozen men rushed
his hiding place and took him prisoner.</p>

<p>He was at once taken before the captain of the
band and questioned as to the number of defenders
and as to the whereabouts of Gen. Blanco.</p>

<p>To all the questions Donald gave an evasive
answer.</p>

<p>"If you will tell me where Gen. Blanco is," said
the captain, "I will give you your freedom."</p>

<p>"That's easy," was Donald's reply. "He is with
Gen. Carranza."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help that, nor does what you believe
make any difference. It is the truth and what
you may believe has nothing whatever to do with
it."</p>

<p>The captain scowled.</p>

<p>"Who is it then, that is defending the house?"</p>

<p>"Americans. You had better let us go, or it will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" href="#Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
be the worse for you. We had a safe conduct from
Gen. Huerta, but we were betrayed."</p>

<p>"If I had my way," said the captain, "I'd shoot
every American in the whole of Mexico."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," from Donald. "We have
nothing against you."</p>

<p>"Take him away," ordered the captain, "and see
that he does not escape. Now let us capture the
others."</p>

<p>There was a rush for the house as Donald was
led back to the stable.</p>

<p>Billie and Mr. Black heard them coming.</p>

<p>"Go to the roof," commanded Mr. Black, speaking
to the two females, "and keep yourselves and
the little girl out of sight. We will hold them back
here as long as we can and then we will also come
to the roof."</p>

<p>The command had hardly been obeyed than the
Mexicans began to crowd up the stairs. They were
met with shot after shot, but at last all the weapons
were empty.</p>

<p>"Run for the roof," said Mr. Black as he arose
to his feet and with his heavy boot kicked a head
which was just coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>Billie obeyed and a minute later the fugitives had
gathered upon the last place of safety left.</p>

<p>"If we only had some ammunition," moaned Billie.
"Can't we do something?"</p>

<p>Then, as in answer to his own query, he picked
up a twelve-pound cannon ball that lay on the roof
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and, raising it above his head with both hands,
hurled it through the opening upon those below.</p>

<p>This unexpected attack caused the besiegers to
draw back, but only for a moment. Then they came
on again. In his desperation, Mr. Black, with almost
superhuman strength, picked up the cannon
itself, just as Billie had picked up the ball, and
hurled it down the stairs.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men fell beneath its weight, while
the others, frightened at such an exhibition of
strength, fell back in dismay.</p>

<p>A shout from the captain urged them forward,
but ere they could gather their courage for another
rush there came the sound of a volley in the patio
below and a minute later Adrian rushed up the
stairs, followed by Captain Lopez and a squad of
his soldiers.</p>

<p>Taken in the rear and entirely by surprise, the
Huerta forces threw down their arms and cried for
mercy, and in less than five minutes after the arrival
of Captain Lopez and his men, the entire force, or
as many as remained, were prisoners.</p>

<h3>A NARROW ESCAPE.</h3>


<p>Two days later the three boys sat on the verandah
of Mr. Black's commodious house awaiting the call
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
to breakfast. Under escort of Captain Lopez' men
they had crossed the valley between Mr. Black's and
Gen. Blanco's the day after the night attack and had
spent the time since in getting a much needed rest.</p>

<p>"It's less than four days since we left the City of
Mexico," remarked Donald, "but it seems like a
month. I wonder how matters stand at Vera
Cruz?"</p>

<p>"From that telegram from Gen. Maas, that we
took from the lieutenant, Admiral Fletcher may
have taken the city," said Billie.</p>

<p>"I hope not," from Adrian.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked both the others.</p>

<p>"'Cause I'd like to be there when it happens."</p>

<p>"Yes, so would I," echoed Billie.</p>

<p>"If he has taken it," ventured Donald, "we may
have difficulty getting through the Mexican lines."</p>

<p>"Well, the best thing we can do," asserted Adrian,
"is to get somewhere and find out what is going
on just as soon as we can."</p>

<p>The call to breakfast interrupted their conversation,
but as soon as they were seated at the table,
they broached the matter to Mr. Black.</p>

<p>"I expect you are right," he said, "but I'd like to
have you stay with me a while. It's mighty lonesome
here for Josie and me."</p>

<p>"If we are at war with the Mexicans," remarked
Billie, "this will be an unhealthy place for an American,
I imagine. I should think you would want to
take your daughter away from here."
</p>

<p>"Oh, Josie and I are not afraid, are we, Josie?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"No indeed, Dad. We are a match for a regiment
of Mexicans when we are on our own ground."</p>

<p>But in spite of the assertion made by Mr. Black
he admitted to the boys after breakfast when Josie
was not present that he wished his daughter was
safe in Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go with us?" asked Adrian.
"We should be pleased to act as an escort."</p>

<p>"Yes," echoed Billie. "We'll see you through."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I had thought of doing," said
Mr. Black. "It's only a good day's ride a-horseback
to Moreno. We have many friends there with
whom I could leave her. If you boys would act as
an escort that far you would be no farther from
Vera Cruz than you are now and I believe you
would have a better chance in reaching the port over
the Tierra Blanca division than on the main line."</p>

<p>"Whether we would or not," replied Adrian, "we
should be glad to act as your escort."</p>

<p>"There is another thing in favor of that route,"
continued Mr. Black. "The farther we keep from
the main line of railroad, the less likely we are to
fall in with the Huerta forces. The southern territory
as far as Santa Lucrecia is practically in the
hands of Carranza."</p>

<p>"From what you say," was Donald's comment,
"it is greatly to our advantage to do as you wish.
Let's consider the matter settled and start at once."</p>

<p>"It's too late in the day to start now," was Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" href="#Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Black's reply. "We shall wait until to-morrow
morning and be on our way by daylight. I don't
want to be riding through the mountains after dark.
There are wild animals that are worse than the
soldiers."</p>

<p>"As the Se&ntilde;ora Blanco can testify," laughed Billie.
"Every time I think of what a close shave
she had, it gives me a chill."</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Black brought out half a
dozen horses for the inspection of his guests.</p>

<p>"A day's ride on a strange horse isn't always an
easy task," he explained, "and I thought you might
amuse yourself trying these. You can each pick
out the one that suits him best."</p>

<p>It was a task which suited the boys better than
any they had undertaken in days, and as they had
not only Mr. Black, but Josie and the General's
wife for spectators, they were more than pleased
to show their dexterity after true cowboy fashion.</p>

<p>The remainder of the afternoon was therefore
spent in riding, throwing the lariat and in shooting,
much to the gratification of Mr. Black, who
declared he had never seen a better exhibition of its
kind.</p>

<p>As a result of their experience, the boys picked
out three medium-sized horses, which Mr. Black
emphatically stated showed their good judgment of
horse flesh, as completely as their riding had proved
their horsemanship.</p>

<p>They were all in the saddle early the following
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
morning, Josie's wound having healed sufficiently
to permit her to ride without danger.</p>

<p>Early morning in the tropics is the pleasantest
time of the day, and although the road from Mr.
Black's hacienda to Moreno would take them from
an altitude of over four thousand feet down to
about two thousand feet above sea level, they
would be sufficiently up in the mountains to make
riding fairly comfortable.</p>

<p>The route chosen took the little party first to
the headquarters of the Carranza force operating
in that section. They were warmly greeted by
General Dorantes, the commanding officer, who furnished
them with a guard of four men and passes
through the lines, "if," he added as he bade them
good luck, "you should find it necessary to pass our
lines. If my reports are correct, we are in possession
of all the territory to the south."</p>

<p>For hours the cavalcade rode on without incident,
stopping only long enough to partake of a
mid-day meal at the hacienda of Don Alvaro Flores,
a friend of Mr. Black's. Late in the afternoon,
however, when about six miles from their destination,
there came to their ears the sound of heavy
firing&mdash;of field pieces mingled with the occasional
roll of a machine gun.</p>

<p>They stopped and listened intently.</p>

<p>"Which direction do you make the firing to be?"
asked Mr. Black of the corporal in command of the
escort.</p>

<p>"In the direction of Tierra Blanca, sir. It sounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
as though our forces might have been attacked."</p>

<p>"How will that affect our journey?"</p>

<p>"Hard to tell, sir. If we win, as we shall, the
enemy may fall back toward Santa Lucrecia, or they
may retreat toward Moreno. If you will take my
advice, you will halt here until the action is over."</p>

<p>The advice seemed most excellent and the cavalcade
came to a halt and the riders dismounted to
give themselves a much-needed rest.</p>

<p>The firing lasted something like twenty minutes,
then suddenly ceased, with the exception of an
occasional "Boom!"</p>

<p>"It sounds as though we had beaten them off,"
said the corporal.</p>

<p>"Is there any way that we can tell in which direction
they have retreated?"</p>

<p>"Only by a reconnoiter."</p>

<p>"Which is our long suit," declared Billie. "You
just stay here with the guard, Mr. Black, and we
three will soon have a report."</p>

<p>Looking to their arms, with which they had
been well supplied by their host before leaving the
hacienda, the boys rode forward toward an elevation
something like a mile distant. From this
they hoped to get a view of the country.</p>

<p>There was a fairly level road and they dashed
along at a good rate despite their long ride. The
horses were as hard as iron and the boys did not
know the meaning of the word tired.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the hill, they found a space,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
from which they could see clear across the valley
through which ran the railroad from Santa Lucrecia
to Vera Cruz. To the right, some miles away, they
could see a good-sized little city which their common
sense told them must be Tierra Blanca. To
the left, but nearer, was the smaller town of Moreno,
for which they were headed.</p>

<p>Between the two towns, and coming directly toward
them, was a band of galloping horsemen, probably
one hundred or more in number.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" was Billie's ejaculation as he
caught sight of the horsemen, "they're coming right
at us."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," from Donald. "They
seem to be on this very road."</p>

<p>"What would you take them to be?" was Billie's
next question.</p>

<p>"Give it up," replied Donald.</p>

<p>"I'll bet I can make a good guess," said Adrian.
"They are a flying column of Huerta cavalry, sent
out to test the Carranza lines. They have paid
their respects to Tierra Blanca and now they are
headed for Cordoba."</p>

<p>"They'll never get there," said Billie. "They'll
run into General Dorante's men."</p>

<p>"But if it's a surprise, they'll cut their way
through."</p>

<p>"It's up to us to see that it is not a surprise!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
cried Donald. "Come on!" and he turned and
dashed back the road they had come.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes they were where they
had left their companions. In another two minutes
they had told their story and in another minute
the corporal and his men were on their way back
toward General Dorante's headquarters.</p>

<p>"It's only a question of whose horses are the
best," said Mr. Black. "And now let us to cover."</p>

<p>Leaving the highway, the Americans turned
sharply to the left and dashed for the shelter of
a piece of woodland something like a half a mile
away. Pell-mell they went over rocks and shrubs,
regardless of themselves or their horses, and succeeded
in reaching the friendly cover just about
three minutes before the cavalry came into sight
over the hill.</p>

<p>"We're all right now," said Mr. Black, "if the
troopers will stick to the road, but if they should
take it into their heads to scatter, we might have
trouble."</p>

<p>With eager eyes the boys watched the oncoming
horsemen, prepared to flee for their lives if they
should be discovered, as they realized how useless
would be any resistance.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer they came until the leaders
were at the very spot they had just left, and then
with a rush they passed by, turning neither to the
right nor to the left.</p>

<p>Every one in the party heaved a deep sigh of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
relief.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder some of them didn't stop," said
Billie.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," laughed Adrian. "Look
yonder," and he pointed to the brow of the hill,
where another, but much smaller body of horsemen
had appeared. "They evidently didn't intend to
have their mission interfered with by fighting a rear-guard
skirmish."</p>

<p>"I think the best thing we can do," said Mr.
Black, "is to surrender ourselves to the pursuers.
They are evidently Carranzistas and our passes will
protect us."</p>

<p>Breaking off a piece of bamboo, Mr. Black tied a
handkerchief to it and raising it above his head the
little party rode out of the woods. They were
sighted at once and a party of horsemen dashed toward
them, and surrounded them.</p>

<p>It was as they had expected and Gen. Dorantes'
passes were immediately recognized by the officer in
command. He was much pleased at the information
given him concerning the corporal and thanked the
boys in the name of Gen. Carranza for their good
offices. He furthermore detached an escort of a
dozen men to see that they reached Moreno in safety
and commended them to the care of the jefe politico,
with the verbal instruction that the boys be allowed
to proceed on their way to Vera Cruz at their will.</p>

<h3>APRIL TWENTY-ONE.</h3>


<p>"Boys," said Mr. Black the following morning
as they were preparing to pay a visit to the jefe
politico, "I want you to do me a favor."</p>

<p>The boys looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Donald, when Mr.
Black did not immediately continue.</p>

<p>"I want you to accept, as a mark of my appreciation
of your bravery and good services, the horses
upon which you are mounted and the accoutrements."</p>

<p>The look of surprise on the faces of the boys
deepened.</p>

<p>"I am sure, sir," replied Donald, speaking for the
others, "we should be pleased to accept them if we
were expecting to remain in the country. We hope,
however, to leave Vera Cruz in a very few days."</p>

<p>"Boys," and Mr. Black's face was most serious,
"there is no knowing when you will reach Vera
Cruz; much less leave it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" from Billie.</p>

<p>"I had a long talk with my friend, Don Ramon,
last night after you were in bed and he tells me that
the railroad between here and Vera Cruz is in the
hands of Gen. Maas, the other side of Guayabo, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
there is almost no chance of your being allowed to
pass through the lines."</p>

<p>"Why not?" from Adrian.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, since we have heard anything,
relations between the two countries have become
more and more strained and the United States has
practically declared a blockade on Vera Cruz. The
entire Atlantic fleet is assembled outside and there
is liable to be a clash at any time."</p>

<p>"Then we'll accept the horses, Mr. Black," spoke
up Donald, "and we'll ride to Vera Cruz. It can't
be more than fifty miles."</p>

<p>"Forty-six by rail," said Mr. Black. "I kind of
thought you might like to try and make it, is why I
want to give you the horses," and the speaker smiled
knowingly.</p>

<p>"The sooner we start the better, I expect," said
Adrian.</p>

<p>"Yes; after you pay your respects to the mayor."</p>

<p>The foregoing conversation explains how it happened
that on the morning of April 21, 1914, the
Broncho Rider Boys looked down from a little hill,
the top of which was covered by tropical foliage,
upon the harbor of Vera Cruz, with the American
fleet in the offing.</p>

<p>By a circuitous route and by two nights of riding,
hiding in the day, the boys had reached this spot
about an hour after sunrise.</p>

<p>"Whew!" was Billie's exclamation as he looked
out across the harbor at the men-of-war flying the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
American flag. "There's a bunch of them, isn't
there?"</p>

<p>"Sure is," from Adrian, "and they look peaceable,
too."</p>

<p>"You never can tell by the looks of a toad how
far it will jump," laughed Donald. "But peaceable
or warlike, I'd like mighty well to be on board one
of them."</p>

<p>"Here, too," from Billie. "I wonder how we're
going to make it."</p>

<p>"How would it do for one of us to try and get
into town and find the American consul?" queried
Adrian.</p>

<p>"Fine," from Donald, "if he succeeded; but bad
if he did not."</p>

<p>"Then what had we better do?"</p>

<p>"Give it up. Suppose we wait here a while and
something may turn up."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what can turn up?" asked
Billie.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but I was thinking that one of
the ships might happen to send a boat ashore for
something. If we saw it coming, we could ride
quickly into town."</p>

<p>Adrian laughed. "I reckon it would be just as
hard to get through the Mexican lines then as now.
No! I'm going out to reconnoiter."</p>

<p>It was an hour later when he returned.</p>

<p>"I've found a way," he said as he threw himself
on the ground and fanned himself vigorously with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
his hat. "It's down by the water works. There
are several Americans down there."</p>

<p>"Good," said Billie. "Let's go. I'm getting
mighty hungry."</p>

<p>"Now don't be in a rush," cautioned Adrian.
"There's a picket between here and there. We'll
have to ride easy. You put the saddles on the
horses. I'm pretty well tired. I want to tell you
it's hot."</p>

<p>Billie was busy with the horses when Don suddenly
pointed out toward the American men-of-war.</p>

<p>"Look!" he exclaimed. "There's something doing."</p>

<p>And sure enough there was.</p>

<p>Out from behind two of the largest vessels there
suddenly darted a number of launches loaded with
blue-jackets and marines.</p>

<p>In another instant they had headed for the shore,
while out behind them trailed the American flag.</p>

<p>The boys sprang to their feet and watched the
approaching boats with the utmost interest.</p>

<p>"There must be a thousand of them!" exclaimed
Billie.</p>

<p>"More than that," said Donald, as his eyes ran
over the oncoming boats. "There's nearer fifteen
hundred."</p>

<p>"And look there," cried Adrian. "See those two
smaller ships moving in toward shore."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they are going to do?"
asked Billie, all in a tremor of excitement.</p>

<p>"Looks to me," replied Donald, "like they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
going to capture the town."</p>

<p>"Why, that's war!" from Adrian.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that what we've been expecting? I
wish I knew what it all means."</p>

<p>As some of the readers may not know what was
the cause of the action it may be explained that a
German steamship had arrived the night before
loaded with arms for Huerta's army. Admiral
Fletcher had no right to seize the German ship, so
he determined to seize the port of Vera Cruz. Then
if the arms were landed they would be in the hands
of the Americans.</p>

<p>"Well," declared Adrian, "whatever else it means,
it means business."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the Mexicans will try to prevent
the landing?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"We'll know in a minute, for they are most
ashore," said Donald.</p>

<p>Donald was right and in another minute a shot
rang out followed by a rattle of musketry.</p>

<p>"Flash! Flash! Bang! Bang!" spoke the howitzers
in the foremost of the launches.</p>

<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! came the sound of three
guns from the ship nearest the city, which proved
to be the <i>Prairie</i>.</p>

<p>The crash of the six-inch shells as they struck in
the city could be heard above the rattle of the rifle
fire which had now become continuous.</p>

<p>"It's a sure enough battle," cried Billie. "Come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
on! Let's go down!" and he flung himself onto his
horse.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" cried Donald, seizing
Billie's horse by the bridle. "You'd be killed by the
fire from our own guns. This is the best place we
could be in while the firing is going on. As soon as
our men have driven the Mexicans out of town,
then we can go in."</p>

<p>"But I want to take a hand in the fun," said
Billie.</p>

<p>"It's no fun, as you'll find after it's all over. No
knowing how many of our boys are being lost, to
say nothing of the Mexicans."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Adrian, who had not taken his
eyes from the scene in the harbor. "There are a
couple of other ships going into action."</p>

<p>Billie turned at sound of Adrian's words. Sure
enough, there came flashes from more guns, as the
<i>Chester</i> and <i>San Francisco</i> moved up into striking
distance, although at that time the boys did not
know the vessels' names.</p>

<p>"What show will the Mexicans have against those
guns!" exclaimed Donald. "They'll be driven out
of town in short order."</p>

<p>Once more Donald was right and after some minutes
of firing, the boys realized that the rifle fire
was becoming less.</p>

<p>"If they retreat, which way do you suppose they
will go?" queried Adrian.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking about that," was Donald's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
reply. "What do you think, Billie?"</p>

<p>"I should think along the main line of railroad."</p>

<p>"And I imagine they'll retreat in every direction,"
said Adrian.</p>

<p>"In which case," advised Donald, "we'd better
be prepared to make a dash through."</p>

<p>"Look here," from Billie. "Can't you see that
the shots are all aimed at one particular place? I'm
sure if we come around by the south, we can get in
behind our men some way. It's a good deal better
chance than to stay here to be shot down by the
retreating Mexicans."</p>

<p>The others were forced to admit the wisdom of
Billie's advice and they proceeded to follow it.</p>

<p>Mounting their horses, they rapidly retraced their
steps for a couple of hundred yards and then headed
for the harbor.</p>

<p>They had not gone more than half a mile when
they caught a glimpse of foot soldiers forming in
line on what appeared to be a parade ground.</p>

<p>"This is no place for us," exclaimed Donald.
"Back to the woods."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too late," from Adrian.</p>

<p>"I hate to run for it," was Billie's comment, "but
it's the best we can do. I have no mind to fall into
Mexican hands right now."</p>

<p>He put spurs to his horse and dashed through a
little clump of trees which grew by the way, closely
followed by the other two.</p>

<p>They seemed to have done just the right thing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" href="#Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
were congratulating themselves upon their lucky
escape, when they heard horses coming from the
other way.</p>

<p>Billie drew his horse up with a sudden turn.</p>

<p>"It looks as though we'd have to fight for it,
boys! If we do let's give a good account of ourselves."</p>

<p>They drew their Winchesters for instant use.</p>

<p>The sound of hoofbeats drew nearer and then
there burst into sight from around a turn in the
road a sight which caused the boys nearly to fall
from their horses with laughter.</p>

<p>Riding on a mule and followed by several peons
on burros was the florid-faced gentleman whom they
had met on the train the day they left the City of
Mexico. He was bare-headed and his coat tails
streamed out in the breeze. He had no saddle and
was clinging onto the mule by grasping him around
the neck.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" he cried as he caught sight of the
boys. "I surrender. I surrender."</p>

<p>Seeing the boys' horses directly in his path, the
mule came to a sudden stop, with both feet stuck
out before him. The result was that the florid-faced
gentleman, who wished to head a company of marines
to drive the Mexicans off the earth, shot forward
over the mule's head and landed in a cactus
bush.</p>

<p>Now a cactus is not a pleasant thing to sit upon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
even when the greatest care is used; but to be shot
into it as from a catapult is more than any one
can bear.</p>

<p>With a yell that might have been heard half a
mile, had it not been for the noise of the guns, the
man scrambled to his feet and darted away down
the hill, while the peons stopped at the unexpected
sight of the boys.</p>

<p>"Americanos!" they cried, and, tumbling off their
burros, fell on their knees in abject terror, as though
expecting that their end had come.</p>

<h3>THE INSULT AVENGED.</h3>


<p>Perceiving that the advantage was on their side,
the boys did not hesitate to profit by it.</p>

<p>"Do as we bid," ordered Donald sternly, "and
your lives will be saved. Disobey and we will not
answer for the consequences."</p>

<p>The kneeling peons uttered never a word, but
raised their eyes with a look of surprise.</p>

<p>"Get up," was the next command.</p>

<p>The peons obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now conduct us to the water front by a route
where there are no Mexican soldiers."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can trust them?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"At any sign of treachery, our first shot will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
for them." Then to the peons: "Now march."</p>

<p>Without a word the peons, five in number, started
back over the route by which they had come but
a minute before.</p>

<p>"Where did the other American come from?"
asked Billie of the peon nearest him as they rode
along.</p>

<p>"Quien sabe, se&ntilde;or," was the hesitating response.
"We saw him riding by and we followed him."</p>

<p>"That's the way with loud talkers," remarked
Adrian. "When the test comes they usually
weaken."</p>

<p>The firing, which had somewhat subsided for a
few minutes, suddenly began again with renewed
vigor, especially on the part of the ships.</p>

<p>"Our boys are getting ready for another advance,"
said Billie, and his manner became greatly
excited. "Let's get there in time to take part."</p>

<p>"I'm willing," declared Adrian. "Come on!"</p>

<p>The two boys dug their spurs into their horses
and dashed forward, upsetting a couple of the peons
in their flight.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" called out Donald. "You'll get into
trouble."</p>

<p>Billie and Adrian paid no attention to his cry,
whereupon he also put spurs to his horse, leaving
the peons gaping with astonishment in the middle
of the road.</p>

<p>And now the boys came into sight of the water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
front where the fighting was going on. It was at
the instant that the order had been given to clear
the space around the custom house, and the boys
saw the marines advance on the double quick.</p>

<p>The Mexicans gave way, but volley after volley
was poured down upon the advancing Americans
from the roofs of houses and from nearby
church towers.</p>

<p>There were several shots in rapid succession from
the <i>Chester</i>, which had drawn in more closely, every
one of which struck a tower where a large force
of Mexicans had gathered.</p>

<p>The tower toppled and fell, carrying many with
it.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried Billie. "Give it to them!" and,
firing his rifle as he went, he rode right down into
the main street.</p>

<p>"He'll be killed by our own men!" cried Donald.</p>

<p>But he was not. Instead he dashed into the open
space in front of the custom house, just as the
marines swept by, his hat off and his rifle cracking
as fast as he could fire.</p>

<p>Seeing that the danger from the marines was
past, Donald and Adrian fell in behind Billie, just
as an officer came around the corner at the head
of another company.</p>

<p>Espying the boys, he halted his command.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We just came to town," replied Billie, "and
we're trying to help avenge the insult to the flag."</p>

<p>"Good!" was the emphatic reply. "Fall in behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
us. You may be of service."</p>

<p>The boys obeyed and followed the company as
it swept up the street. Presently they came to
a barricade, behind which the marines had taken
a stand. The boys expected the command to halt,
but instead they passed the barricade and pushed
onward toward the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>All the time there was a continuous fire upon
them by men secreted on the roofs of houses.</p>

<p>"I'd clean out those snipers if I were in command,"
said Donald to his companions.</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth ere another
company of marines made its appearance and
the men dashed into the houses on either side of
the street.</p>

<p>"Somebody has the same idea, Don," was Billie's
comment as they rode along.</p>

<p>Two blocks farther came the order to halt and
entrench. A minute later the officer called the boys
toward him.</p>

<p>"Would you rather lend us your horses, or act
as orderlies?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If it's all the same to you," was the reply, "we'll
serve as orderlies."</p>

<p>"Very well. Will you," turning to Adrian, "go
back to the custom house and tell Captain Rush
that we have reached our position. You," to Billie,
"ride with all speed to the landing and say that the
enemy has retreated toward the water works. They
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
should not be allowed to stop long enough to do
any damage."</p>

<p>The two boys were off like the wind to carry the
orders.</p>

<p>"Anything for me?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Not for the present. Better dismount and get
behind something."</p>

<p>Two minutes later Adrian pulled up in front of
the Custom House and delivered his message, while
Billie kept on to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Do you know where the water works are?"
asked the officer to whom Billie gave his order.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Then lead us to it."</p>

<p>Without a word Billie obeyed and the Jackies
followed on the run.</p>

<p>The information was evidently received none too
soon, for they encountered quite a force of Mexicans,
guarding the works.</p>

<p>A volley from the bluejackets was returned by
a scattering fire and the Mexicans turned and fled.</p>

<p>But the volley had been sufficient to lose Billie
his mount, as his horse came to his knees with a
bullet in his shoulder.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see the cause of Billie's fall
any more than to ask if he was hit, the Jackies
pushed on toward the water works, leaving Billie
to look out for himself as best he could until the
work in hand was completed.</p>

<p>"This is sure enough tough luck," was Billie's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" href="#Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
comment as he helped the horse to his feet and
examined the wound. "It will lay him up for a
week."</p>

<p>He took the horse by the bridle and led him
slowly back toward the Custom House, where he
reported to an officer and hunted up Adrian.</p>

<p>"What had we better do now?" he asked. "I'd
like to find a place to tend to my horse."</p>

<p>"The fighting seems about over," was Adrian's
reply, "and I reckon the horse will be given attention
by some one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to make any trouble, Ad! If
nobody objects, suppose we go hunt a stable."</p>

<p>They were about to leave when a sergeant
stopped them.</p>

<p>"You're to follow me to the Captain," he said.
"Here," to a marine who stood by, "take charge
of these horses and see that the lame one is cared
for."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they will take our horses away from
us?" muttered Adrian as they followed the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Give it up. I wonder what he wants of us?"</p>

<p>It did not take them long to find out.</p>

<p>"Are you the boys that brought the messages
from Lieutenant Blunt?" asked Captain Rush.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you undertake another mission?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," replied Adrian.</p>

<p>"Same here, sir," from Billie, "but my horse has
been wounded."</p>

<p>"That's bad. However, I guess we can find another."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, sir. I can borrow Don's."</p>

<p>"Who is Don?"</p>

<p>"He's the other one of us, sir. He is still out
with Lieutenant Blunt."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Captain, "either two of you
will do. What I want is to find out to just what
point the Mexican army is falling back. Do you
think you can find out?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Very well. My compliments to Lieutenant Blunt
and give him this order. He will pass two of you
through the lines. The other can remain with him.
Sergeant, their horses."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, both astride Adrian's horse
and leading the other, they appeared at the outpost
and delivered the order.</p>

<p>"Which two shall it be?" laughed the lieutenant
as he looked the boys over.</p>

<p>"I guess it will have to be Adrian and Don," replied
Billie ruefully. "I've had glory enough for
one day. The insult to the flag has been avenged
and the Stars and Stripes are floating over Vera
Cruz."</p>

<p>"I think it's only fair that Don, as you call him,
should share in the adventure," said the lieutenant,
"and the sooner you go the better. It is almost
sundown now."</p>

<p>Then as Donald and Adrian started on their mission:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Success to you and report here when you
return."</p>

<p>"Is there any place near here where I can care
for my horse?" asked Billie as soon as the others
had passed out of sight.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. There are stables in almost any of
these houses. Here, try this one," and the lieutenant
indicated the one before which they were
standing.</p>

<p>Billie knocked on the big door, but there was
no reply.</p>

<p>"Knock louder," laughed the lieutenant. "Use
your boot."</p>

<p>Billie used his foot and with such vigor that
the gate flew open.</p>

<p>When no one appeared to answer his summons,
he stuck his head inside the patio and called lustily.</p>

<p>"Must be deserted," he finally remarked. "Such
being the case, lieutenant, I reckon I might as well
take possession."</p>

<p>"Sure. Go ahead. If every one has gone, I
may join you later."</p>

<p>Billie led his horse within and looked around.
It was a large house and the patio was the most
elaborate Billie had ever seen. He had thought that
Pedro's home in Mexico City was fine, but this was
much finer.</p>

<p>"They must be swells," was the lad's comment.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
"I reckon they became frightened and have run
away with General Maas."</p>

<p>He started to lead the horse to the stable and
then stopped.</p>

<p>"I might as well shut this big gate," he thought.
"I'll leave the little gate open so the lieutenant can
come in."</p>

<p>He pushed the big gate together and dropped the
bolt in its place.</p>

<p>"Now to do something for the horse," and he
turned to the animal which stood patiently by.</p>

<p>Then he stopped and stood in mute astonishment
at what his eyes beheld.</p>

<p>In the center of the patio, with rifle in hand,
aimed squarely at his head, stood a figure he had
last seen on the banks of the Rio Grande more than
a year before&mdash;the figure of a man whom he had
known only as Santiago.</p>

<p>The recognition was mutual, but instead of the
friendliness which had always before marked the
attitude of the strange man, there was now upon his
face a look of the most bitter hatred.</p>

<h3>SHADOWING AN ARMY.</h3>


<p>When Donald and Adrian left the city they rode
slowly along for some distance without any sign
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" href="#Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the retreating Mexicans, except the occasional
sight of some camp utensil which had been thrown
aside as too heavy to carry. Occasionally they met
peons or women, who looked at them curiously, but
all of whom were more than willing to tell of the
army that had so recently passed.</p>

<p>"How many men do you suppose General Maas
has?" queried Adrian.</p>

<p>"The lieutenant said it was supposed he had about
seven thousand. It may be more, and it may be
less."</p>

<p>"Well, they're certainly light-footed," laughed
Adrian. "Don't you think we ought to get closer?"</p>

<p>"If we can without being seen."</p>

<p>They put spurs to their horses and for a mile
or more galloped along at a fair speed.</p>

<p>Then from a little eminence they saw the rear
guard of the retreating army.</p>

<p>"This is near enough," cautioned Donald.</p>

<p>They halted and watched the marching men.</p>

<p>"How far would you say we are from town,
Don?"</p>

<p>"At least seven or eight miles."</p>

<p>"Do you know what towns are in this direction?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest idea. That's the next thing
we must find out."</p>

<p>The enemy having by this time passed out of
sight, they again spurred forward, but holding their
distance.</p>

<p>Darkness had now fallen and the boys were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" href="#Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
obliged to pick their way more carefully.</p>

<p>For half an hour they rode silently and then
Donald spoke:</p>

<p>"They certainly will not march all night. They
must have some place in mind."</p>

<p>"So I think," from Adrian. "But there seems
no sign of a halt."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, however, they caught sight
of a fire light.</p>

<p>"That looks like it might be a camp," suggested
Adrian.</p>

<p>They rode cautiously forward.</p>

<p>"It surely is," affirmed Donald a couple of minutes
later. "We'd better dismount and do a little
reconnoitering on foot."</p>

<p>The suggestion was immediately put into effect.</p>

<p>Leaving their horses tethered beneath a giant
palm, which would serve as a landmark, the boys
crept stealthily forward. In a few minutes they
were near enough to see figures about the fire.</p>

<p>"They are evidently getting ready to pass the
night," said Donald.</p>

<p>"Yes," from Adrian, "and there is another fire
off yonder," and he pointed to the right.</p>

<p>"They are getting ready to post their pickets,"
explained Donald.</p>

<p>"Then we'd better get busy, Don. There must
be some way of finding out where the army is going
to stop."</p>

<p>As with one accord they drew still nearer the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" href="#Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
camp, they could smell the coffee and their appetites
began to assert themselves.</p>

<p>"Wish I had some," whispered Adrian.</p>

<p>"You'll get to be as bad as Billie first thing you
know," was the retort. "But, hush! There comes
some one."</p>

<p>They lay flat on the ground and listened.</p>

<p>Whoever it might be was coming directly toward
them.</p>

<p>Not a move did the boys make, hoping that they
might not be discovered, but ready to act if they
were.</p>

<p>When within ten feet of them the footsteps halted
and they heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"This will be far enough. You are the end man
on the line."</p>

<p>"Bueno, caporal!"</p>

<p>"Keep a close watch," cautioned the corporal.
"You never know what these Americans may do."</p>

<p>"Si, Se&ntilde;or. How far are we from Vera Cruz?"</p>

<p>"About four leagues" (twelve miles). "General
Maas will make a stand at Tejeria, about a league
further on."</p>

<p>Then as he moved away. "Remember now, no
sleeping. This is a real war."</p>

<p>"Bueno, mi caporal. I understand."</p>

<p>The corporal departed and the sentry, shouldering
his rifle, began pacing his station.</p>

<p>A minute later Donald gave Adrian a dig with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" href="#Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
his elbow as a signal, and they slowly crawled
away.</p>

<p>"That's the information we are after," whispered
Donald when they were out of earshot. "Now to
get back to Vera Cruz as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>They rose to their feet and ran swiftly but silently
toward the palm tree, where their horses were
tethered.</p>

<p>Suddenly Adrian stopped and grabbed Donald by
the arm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ad?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Can't you see! There is some one there with
the horses."</p>

<p>They both peered through the darkness and Donald
quickly perceived that Adrian was right.</p>

<p>Then as by one impulse they drew a few steps
nearer.</p>

<p>In the dim starlight they were able to make out
the figures of several men.</p>

<p>"Do you think they are soldiers?" whispered Don.</p>

<p>Adrian shook his head.</p>

<p>"Camp followers. Thieves," he whispered.</p>

<p>Donald nodded his head in acquiescence.</p>

<p>The boys lay down upon the ground and put
their heads together.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be any trick at all," whispered Donald,
"if it were not for the pickets. But any noise
will bring down upon us a couple of hundred men.
Maybe more. We have simply got to dispose of
that outfit without noise. But how?"</p>

<p>"Bad job," was Adrian's only reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" href="#Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"If the horses were only our Wyoming cow
ponies, they'd come at our call."</p>

<p>"But they're not," replied Adrian.</p>

<p>For several minutes neither spoke, but lay silently
watching the movements of the men about
the horses.</p>

<p>"How many can you make out, Ad?"</p>

<p>"Five."</p>

<p>"I don't see but four."</p>

<p>Adrian pointed to the left, about ten or twelve
feet, to one who stood alone.</p>

<p>"What's he doing there?"</p>

<p>"Give it up." Then a moment later: "I have
it!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"He's watching for us to return. That's what
they're all waiting for. They think we'll be a great
catch."</p>

<p>"That's just it," from Donald. "Let's fool
them!"</p>

<p>"Well, first, let's capture the one yonder. We'll
show them a Wyoming Indian trick."</p>

<p>Slowly and silently the boys wiggled their way
to where the lone robber stood. Then as silently as
a ghost Donald arose, while Adrian bent on his
knees.</p>

<p>There was a swift movement and Donald's arm
was around the Mexican's neck, shutting off his
wind, while Adrian pulled his feet from beneath
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" href="#Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
him. In another minute he was bound by his own
sash and gagged with a handful of grass.</p>

<p>"That's one!" exclaimed Donald, as he sat upon
his prisoner's chest. "Now, how about the others?"</p>

<p>"Not so easy, Don."</p>

<p>"But it has to be done," declared Donald.
"Scratch your head."</p>

<p>Adrian did so, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Time was passing and they did not know how
long ere something would turn up, when Donald
gave Adrian a kick.</p>

<p>"Look! They're getting uneasy."</p>

<p>This was undoubtedly true, as the men were moving
about and one of them even had the temerity
to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden Adrian spoke.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" he exclaimed under his breath.
"Help drag this chap farther away."</p>

<p>They picked him up bodily and carried him fifteen
or twenty feet.</p>

<p>"Now, listen," said Adrian, "both of you. You,
Don, sneak as near the horses as you dare. I'll
give you just five minutes by my watch. Then I
am going to give this man one chance for his life.
I am going to take the gag from his mouth and
let him give one call for help. If he makes another
sound, it will be his last."</p>

<p>"Then what?"</p>

<p>"Those fellows have waited so long that they are
tired. They will all rush to where they expect to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" href="#Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
find him. Then you will rush in and cut the tethers.
By the time they find this man I will be with you.
Sabe?"</p>

<p>"Good!" from Donald. "I'm off."</p>

<p>In exactly five minutes by his watch Adrian gave
the prisoner a rough shake.</p>

<p>"You know what I said?"</p>

<p>The man nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well, I am now going to take out your gag.
If you make more than one cry, or utter more than
one word, your own knife will finish you."</p>

<p>He held the knife before the man's eyes. Then
with the knife in one hand, Adrian pulled the wad
of grass from between the prisoner's teeth.</p>

<p>No sooner had the man drawn one long breath
than he let out a yell that might have been heard
half a mile and which he was about to repeat with
variations, when with a swift movement, Adrian
forced the grass back into his mouth and the yell
died in a dismal gurgle.</p>

<p>"I ought to use the knife," said Adrian, "but I
guess this will do."</p>

<p>With a bound he sprang to his feet and dashed
to where Donald was already performing his part
of the work.</p>

<p>The plan had worked exactly as Adrian had figured,
and in another moment the boys were astride
the horses and away toward Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>But one thing they had not taken into consideration.
That single yell of their erstwhile prisoner
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" href="#Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
had aroused the Mexican pickets and from half
a dozen directions came the sound of rifle shots and
then the sound of a bugle calling to arms.</p>

<p>Even while Adrian was running toward the
horses, the excitement had begun, and as the boys
started on their homeward ride, a volley from the
encamped forces sent the bullets whistling by their
ears.</p>

<p>"This is no place for us!" cried Donald. "Don't
be afraid to use the spur. It is our only chance."</p>

<p>And now as they rode furiously forward, came
the sound of firing on their left and some distance
ahead.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" called out Adrian as they
rode neck and neck through the darkness.</p>

<p>"Search me, Ad; but our only chance is in our
horses," and Donald again plied the spur.</p>

<p>Outlined against the sky at the top of a small
knoll, they could see a small body of horsemen.</p>

<p>"Keep away to the right," said Donald. "Keep
in the valley and in the shadow," and he drew off
the beaten highway, with Adrian close behind.</p>

<p>On the soft earth their horses' hoofs made no
sound and in a couple of minutes more they descended
into a little valley and the noise of the alarm
passed out of hearing.</p>

<p>"It was a mighty close shave," declared Adrian
a few minutes later, when they pulled their horses
down to a walk to allow them to catch their breath.</p>

<p>"Sure was," from Donald, "but we got the information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" href="#Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
we went after."</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were challenged by the
American pickets, which had been thrown even
further forward than where the boys had passed
through the lines. They stated their mission and
were at once sent under guard to the officer of
the day.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you!" was the lieutenant's salutation as
he saw who it was. "Did you get what you went
after?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," from Donald. "The enemy has halted
at Tejeria, fifteen miles away."</p>

<p>"Well done. I'll send an orderly to carry the
report to headquarters. You boys are entitled to
a rest."</p>

<p>"Where's Billie?" asked Adrian, looking around
after the orderly had departed.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Billie. Our chum."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the lieutenant. "He's disappeared."</p>

<p>"Disappeared?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He went into this house here," pointing
to the building before which he had stationed himself,
"and when I went in later to see how he was
coming on with his wounded horse, I found the
horse standing in the middle of the patio, but your
chum had disappeared."</p>

<p>"And then what?" queried Donald.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I made up my mind he had gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" href="#Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
after something to put on his horse and I haven't
thought much about him since."</p>

<p>"Then it's up to us to find him. Can we go inside?"</p>

<p>"Sure," laughed the lieutenant. "Go as far as
you like, only keep inside the lines."</p>

<p>Without more words the boys entered the patio.</p>

<h3>BILLIE GETS A SURPRISE.</h3>


<p>When Billie found himself looking into the
muzzle of a rifle in the hands of Santiago, his first
impulse was to call out; but the expression on Santiago's
face caused him to remain silent.</p>

<p>While the strange man owed his life to the lad,
as is related in the story of the "Broncho Rider
Boys with the Texas Rangers," there was that in
the man's face which told that he was under a
severe mental strain, and Billie did not think it wise
to presume upon his former friendship.</p>

<p>Therefore, he remained quiet, waiting for Santiago
to speak.</p>

<p>If he recognized Billie, he gave no intimation of
the fact; but in a harsh voice commanded: "Up
with your hands!"</p>

<p>Billie obeyed.</p>

<p>"Turn to the left and march. In there," he continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" href="#Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
a moment later as Billie approached an open
door in the rear of the patio.</p>

<p>Into the house Billie went&mdash;into a large room,
but dimly lighted. Santiago followed, closing the
door behind him with a kick.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I shoot you down like a dog?"
asked Santiago as soon as the door was closed.</p>

<p>"I can't see any reason," was the reply, "except
that it might cause you a lot of trouble when it
was found out. I imagine that Admiral Fletcher
is going to be pretty severe upon snipers and others
who shoot Americans."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Santiago angrily. "I spit upon
Americans! Bah!"</p>

<p>"That's all right," Billie agreed, "if it's the way
you feel about it."</p>

<p>"Just because you Americans have driven away
a few soldiers with the guns of your great fleet, you
don't think you can conquer Mexico, do you?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought much about it."</p>

<p>"Then it's time you did, as you may never have
another chance."</p>

<p>"Well, then," explained Billie, "I'll tell you how
it looks to me. You might a great deal better be
governed by the United States than by a man like
Huerta."</p>

<p>"Huerta! Huerta!" fairly screamed Santiago.
"He is not the governor of Mexico."</p>

<p>"No," from Billie. "He calls himself the provisional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" href="#Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
president. In reality he is a dictator."</p>

<p>"He is a murderer!" shouted the thoroughly excited
man.</p>

<p>"Then what are you worrying about? All that
the Americans want is to get rid of Huerta. They
don't want Mexico. Didn't you know that,
Santiago?"</p>

<p>"What? Who calls me Santiago? I am Ixtazhl,
Prince of the Aztecs and guardian of the treasures
of Montezuma. Who calls me Santiago?"</p>

<p>In his excitement he rested the stock of his rifle
upon the floor and bent upon Billie a gaze so fierce
as greatly to disconcert him for the moment.</p>

<p>But Billie was not a lad to be easily unnerved
and after a moment he replied calmly:</p>

<p>"I call you by the only name I know. It was
the one you used on the Rio Grande when you sent
me on a mission to Pancho Villa."</p>

<p>"Villa! Villa!" repeated Santiago, as though
trying to recall something that had passed from
his memory. "Villa! Where have I heard that
name before?"</p>

<p>"On the Rio Grande is all I can tell you. Do
you remember Don Rafael?"</p>

<p>At mention of the name the expression on Santiago's
face changed again, this time to one of fiercest
rage.</p>

<p>"Don Rafael!" he cried. "Don Rafael! Now I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" href="#Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
know you! You are Don Rafael. That is why I
should kill you!"</p>

<p>"Great Scott, no, I am not Don Rafael!" shouted
Billie as Santiago again raised his rifle and the
lad perceived that he had to do with a crazy man.
"I'm the boy that saved your life when Don Rafael
tried to kill you. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>Again Santiago lowered his weapon, and again
there came upon his face that puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Santiago&mdash;I mean Prince Iztazil, or
whatever you call it, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Santiago eyed him suspiciously, but finally laid his
rifle across a table in the center of the room and
approached nearer the lad.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said in a whisper. "I am the guardian
of the treasure of Montezuma. It is to be used
to free Mexico from the Spaniard. He must be
driven out. The land belongs to the Aztec."</p>

<p>"But where is the Aztec?" queried Billie. "I
know him not."</p>

<p>"I am he. The peons are my people. The Spaniard&mdash;bah!
He owns the houses and he owns the
lands; but he must be driven out."</p>

<p>"Isn't that what Villa says?"</p>

<p>"Villa? Villa?" again repeated Santiago, and
again he lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>For some minutes he remained motionless ere
he stepped back, picked up his rifle and started for
a door leading to a stairway.</p>

<p>"Come!" he commanded. "I will show you."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better take care of the horse first?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" href="#Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
asked Billie, not at all anxious to be wandering
around with an armed lunatic. "He may die."</p>

<p>"What is a horse when the future of Mexico is
at stake, my son? Come with me and you shall
hear a strange tale."</p>

<p>"I have heard one already," was Billie's mental
comment, but realizing by the term son which Santiago
had applied to him that he was in no immediate
danger and trusting to his wits to finally overcome
the strange man should it become necessary,
he followed.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs was another door, which
Santiago opened and entered. It was a sort of ante-room,
much like the entrance into a lodge room.
Around the walls was a motley collection of firearms,
swords, spears and smaller weapons.</p>

<p>Stopping in front of one of the racks, Santiago
placed his rifle in it, and then from another took a
couple of small swords, one of which he handed
to Billie.</p>

<p>"This is a bug house sure enough," muttered the
boy as he took the sword and examined it curiously.
"I wonder what next?"</p>

<p>He had not long to wait, for opening a closet,
Santiago took therefrom two beautifully embroidered
robes, one of which he threw over his own
shoulders and the other of which he put on Billie.</p>

<p>"It doesn't hardly match my hat," laughed Billie.</p>

<p>Without a word, Santiago removed Billie's sombrero
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" href="#Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and hung it on a peg in the closet, which he
closed.</p>

<p>Then he opened another door and led Billie into
a large, brilliantly lighted room, hung with the richest
tapestries.</p>

<p>"Looks like we had strayed into some Turkish
bath house," thought Billie, "but I might as well
see the thing through."</p>

<p>"Sit here beside me, my son," Santiago finally
said. "You shall become my heir. I will introduce
you to the court."</p>

<p>Santiago clapped his hands, as though bidding
a servant to attend; but there was no response.</p>

<p>He turned his head from one side to the other
as though in amazement and again clapped his
hands, this time with vigor.</p>

<p>After a moment's delay, there was a movement
behind one of the draperies and presently the curtain
was drawn back and a man's face appeared.</p>

<p>"Come hither," commanded Santiago.</p>

<p>The man obeyed.</p>

<p>"Where are the others?" demanded Santiago.</p>

<p>"Oh, se&ntilde;or," cried the man, "the others have hidden
themselves in the cellar!"</p>

<p>"Slaves! Cowards!" exclaimed Santiago. "What
do they fear?"</p>

<p>"The great guns, se&ntilde;or. We might all be killed."</p>

<p>"You will certainly be killed if you do not mind
what I say," was the reply as Santiago drew his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" href="#Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
sword. "Now summon the court that I may introduce
my son."</p>

<p>The man bowed and left the room, and in a few
minutes returned accompanied by two more men
and several women, all arrayed in fantastic costumes.</p>

<p>All bowed as they entered, and Santiago waved
his hand.</p>

<p>"This is my son and heir," he said. "Come and
kiss his hand."</p>

<p>They all came forward and kissed Billie's hand,
which he held out in order to facilitate the job.</p>

<p>"Now," said Santiago, "we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now," interrupted Billie, "if it is all the same
to you, Prince, we'll have supper. I haven't had
a mouthful to eat since daylight. I'm 'most starved
to death."</p>

<p>"It is well," agreed Santiago. "It is well that
my heir should not die of hunger. Let the table
be placed."</p>

<p>The order seemed to meet with general approval,
and in the course of half an hour there was spread
what would have proved a feast at any time, but
which was beyond description to a hungry boy; and
the way he waded into the food was a caution.</p>

<p>During all this time Santiago had uttered never
a word, nor would he eat but the smallest portion
of food&mdash;a taste of every dish which he set before
his guest.</p>

<p>"My son tells the truth," Santiago finally remarked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" href="#Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
as Billie pushed back his chair with the
single word "Bastante," meaning enough.</p>

<p>"I always try to," was the smiling rejoinder, for
Billie was now in the very best humor. Eating was
his strong point and he had gone the limit.</p>

<p>"Clear away the feast and then reassemble," was
Santiago's next order.</p>

<p>This order was carried into effect, and the servants
also must have enjoyed a square meal, for it
was more than an hour ere they again assembled,
during which time Billie sank back in his chair and
slumbered peacefully.</p>

<p>He was finally awakened by a hand laid upon his
arm.</p>

<p>"Awake, my son," were the words he heard. "It
is now time that I reveal to you the secret of my
life. It is now time that I should tell you the
secret of the treasure of Montezuma."</p>

<p>"That's right, Prince," said Billie sleepily. "Let
her go."</p>

<p>Santiago regarded him interrogatively.</p>

<p>"What said my son?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Prince. I forgot you only understood
good English. Let her go, means proceed with the
secret."</p>

<p>"Let her go. Let her go," Santiago repeated a
couple of times. "Yes," he continued, "I had forgotten
about her."</p>

<p>He clapped his hands and the same servant who
had first appeared approached his chair.</p>

<p>Santiago gave an order in a language which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" href="#Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Billie did not understand, but which he imagined
was Indian, and the servant withdrew, only to reappear
a few minutes later with a young woman
who greatly resembled Santiago and who was also
arrayed in a gorgeous costume.</p>

<p>She had evidently not expected to meet a
stranger, for she drew back upon seeing Billie and
the color rushed to her face.</p>

<p>"Come hither, daughter," was Santiago's command.</p>

<p>The young woman obeyed.</p>

<p>"Lucia," said Santiago, "this is the honorable
young man whom I have chosen for my heir.
Henceforth consider him your betrothed. The marriage
shall take place one new moon from to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, Father," cried the girl, her face becoming
even more scarlet than before, "I cannot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" interrupted Billie, springing to his feet,
"neither can I. You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Santiago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Santiago, springing to his feet and
again drawing his sword. "Who calls me Santiago?
I am Prince Ixtazhl of the great Aztec nation
and guardian of the treasure of Montezuma!"</p>

<p>He raised his sword and would have stricken
Billie down ere the boy could have prevented had
not the young woman thrown herself between them
and seized his arm.</p>

<p>At the same instant the door from the ante-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" href="#Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
opened and Donald and Adrian entered.</p>

<h3>A MISSION FOR FUNSTON.</h3>


<p>"Santiago!" exclaimed Donald.</p>

<p>"By all that's great!" from Adrian.</p>

<p>"Help!" cried Lucia. "He will do something
desperate!"</p>

<p>Donald and Adrian sprang forward, but their
assistance was not needed. Billie had by this time
gathered his wits and in a twinkling the mad-man
was disarmed.</p>

<p>"Shall we bind him?" asked Adrian as they came
forward.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied Billie as the now helpless
man sank down upon the chair. "He isn't dangerous."</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" queried Donald.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much! He simply wanted to make
me his heir and marry me to his daughter."</p>

<p>Donald and Adrian cast an admiring gaze upon
Lucia, who was now kneeling at her father's side.</p>

<p>"Well," said Adrian in an aside, "I don't see why
you should object to that."</p>

<p>"Who said I objected?" demanded Billie. "It is
the young woman who objects."</p>

<p>"But whoever supposed he had a daughter?" said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" href="#Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Donald.</p>

<p>"Not I," from Billie. "But this is certainly a
queer mess."</p>

<p>Then to Lucia: "How long has he been in this
way, Se&ntilde;orita?"</p>

<p>"Only a few days. Since this trouble with the
Americanos."</p>

<p>"But how could that affect him?"</p>

<p>"It is a long story, se&ntilde;or. For years he has been
trying to overthrow the government. When Madero
was made president, he was happy. Then came
that awful tragedy, by which Madero was killed.
Since that time he has not been himself. But when
it became evident that the United States would interfere
he became as you have seen him to-day."</p>

<p>"When I told him that all the United States
wanted was to get rid of Huerta, he was much
pleased," explained Billie. "That was when he proposed
to make me his heir."</p>

<p>Lucia's cheeks grew red, as she asked: "And did
you accept his proposal?"</p>

<p>"I neither accepted nor rejected. I just followed
him in to see what would happen next."</p>

<p>"But would you accept?" insisted Lucia.</p>

<p>"That depends," replied Billie, with a touch of
color in his own face. "But what had we better
do now? You and I will discuss the other question
later."</p>

<p>"The best thing we can do," interposed Donald,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" href="#Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
"is to report to Lieutenant Blunt. Isn't there some
place, Se&ntilde;orita, where your father can be placed for
safe-keeping?"</p>

<p>"He will be perfectly safe here with me, se&ntilde;ors,
if the servants are allowed to remain."</p>

<p>"They certainly will be," declared Billie. "I will
personally vouch for that. We have done Captain
Rush a good turn to-day and I know he will be
glad to do that much for us. And besides, the
Americans will harm no one."</p>

<p>Lucia gave Billie a grateful look as she replied:</p>

<p>"Ah, se&ntilde;or, I shall trust it all to you. I can
see that you are a friend of my father and I know
you are telling the truth."</p>

<p>"You bet you can trust me," was Billie's emphatic
reply. "Come on, fellows, let's go look after
my horse."</p>

<p>In the door Billie turned:</p>

<p>"I'll leave my robe in the cupboard, Se&ntilde;orita;
and, if you don't mind, I'll ask Lieutenant Blunt to
make himself at home in the patio."</p>

<p>"The house is yours, se&ntilde;or. Do as you think
best."</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Adrian as they descended
the stairs to the patio, "this is getting
serious."</p>

<p>"What?" queried Donald.</p>

<p>"Why this affair of Billie and the young lady
we have just left."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" from Billie. "It isn't half as serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" href="#Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
as what I saw at Moreno."</p>

<p>"No!" laughed Donald. "I saw that myself; but
Josie is an American. Hey, Ad?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's very nice to be making remarks
about young ladies in their absence," retorted
Adrian, bristling up.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Adrian!" laughed Billie. "You
started it. But what do you make out of Santiago?"</p>

<p>"He's evidently a rich old chap with a bug.
That's all."</p>

<p>"Well," commented Billie, with a nod of his head,
"strange things do happen when you travel.
Who'd have thought we'd ever see the old chap
again, and at a time like this?" and he went back
to where Adrian and Donald had stabled the horses,
to see if there was anything he could do for the
wounded animal.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Blunt was made acquainted
with the conditions prevailing in the house, he immediately
took possession of the lower floor and
from that time on until the arrival of General
Funston with the Fifth Brigade, it was made one
of the official residences.</p>

<p>The week following the occupation of Vera Cruz
by the American forces was a busy one for our
boys. Because of their intimate knowledge with
the Spanish language, they were continually in
demand. There was never a verbal message from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" href="#Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the American Admiral to some Mexican official but
what they were called upon, and they very soon
made friends of every Jackie and marine in the
city.</p>

<p>Ten days later the boys stood upon the wharf
awaiting the arrival of the first boatload of General
Funston's regulars from the big transports which
had anchored in the harbor the night before. Because
of the shallowness of the water, everything in
Vera Cruz harbor has to be brought ashore in
small boats, known as lighters. As the boys watched
the first of these to approach there was something
in the face and bearing of the officer in command
which attracted their attention.</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Donald, "I seem to
know that face. Don't you, Billie?"</p>

<p>"Does look kind o' familiar. Where have we
seen him?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you!" cried Adrian. "It's the lieutenant
who was in charge of the patrol on the Rio Grande."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Grant!" exclaimed Billie. "Sure as
you're born. Well this is luck!"</p>

<p>"Luck? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, maybe he'll be able to tell me whatever
became of those drafts for ten thousand pounds
that I took from old Don Pablo."</p>

<p>His companions laughed.</p>

<p>"Still thinking about that, are you?" said Donald.
"Why of course you'll never hear of them
again. The bank is simply in that much."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," admitted Billie, "but I'll get something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" href="#Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
official."</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>It was several days later, though, after the regulars
had taken possession of the city and the navy
forces had withdrawn to their ships. The boys
were sitting in Lieutenant Grant's quarters, to whom
they had offered their services as soon after his
landing as they were able, and were laughing over
their adventures on the border.</p>

<p>"It was certainly a close call you boys had," the
lieutenant was saying. "I'm not sure but our neutrality
was mighty near a breaking point. What do
you think, Billie?"</p>

<p>"Possibly so; Americans will be Americans. But
say, Lieutenant, whatever was done about those
drafts I took from Don Pablo? I've never been
called upon to tell my story, nor have they ever
come back to me."</p>

<p>"That's because you were out of the United
States," replied Lieutenant Grant. "It was less than
a month ago that I was asked if I knew your whereabouts.
Uncle Sam has decided that he has no claim
to the drafts and they were returned to me. I
have them in my army chest. If they are any good
to you, I shall be pleased to hand them over."</p>

<p>"I guess they are not much use to any one,"
sighed Billie mournfully. "My father says no bank
would cash them without Don Pablo's signature,
and no one can get that."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you take it so philosophically," laughed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" href="#Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the lieutenant. "I hope you'll have better luck next
time."</p>

<p>The boys arose to leave.</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"No place in particular. We thought we'd go
home."</p>

<p>"You mean to the United States?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night," laughed Adrian. "Just to the
house where we are living. It belongs to old Santiago."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>Briefly the boys narrated what they knew about
him on the Rio Grande, how they had met him
here, and why they were staying at his house.</p>

<p>"Has he no other name?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I suppose so," replied Billie. "We
always call him Prince to his face, and his daughter
as the Princess Lucia. Of course, it is all make-believe,
but it is one way of keeping him quiet."</p>

<p>He called to one of Santiago's servants, whom
Lucia had lent them to look after their horses.</p>

<p>"Oh, Chomo!" he said. "Do you know what
Santiago's surname is?"</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or. It is Ojeda."</p>

<p>"What?" cried all the boys at once. "Ojeda?
Why, that was old Don Pablo's name."</p>

<p>The boys stood and eyed each other in speechless
wonder. The same thought was in all their
minds.</p>

<p>"Do you think it is possible?" asked Billie at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" href="#Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
last.</p>

<p>"Do I think what is possible?" asked Lieutenant
Grant.</p>

<p>"Why, that Santiago could have given those
drafts to the stranger so as not to be known in
the matter."</p>

<p>"Possibly. He seems a man of mystery."</p>

<p>"Well," declared Billie, "I am going to find out."</p>

<p>"How, I should like to know," asked Donald.
"He's too crazy to remember anything, even if he
wanted to tell you."</p>

<p>"You forget Lucia," said Billie.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I haven't," laughed Donald, "and I have
no doubt she would tell you all about it if she knew;
but I do not believe she does. Santiago is too deep
to have entrusted his secrets to a girl not yet out
of her teens."</p>

<p>"You never can tell," remarked the lieutenant.
"Men with a hobby do strange things. You'd better
ride along with me to headquarters. I'd like
to introduce you to General Funston. He's a man
after your own hearts. You know how he went
out and captured Aguinaldo when he was in the
Philippines."</p>

<p>"I've read about it," replied Adrian. "It was a
bold deed."</p>

<p>"Sure was," said Donald. "We'll be mighty
glad to meet him."</p>

<p>It may also be said that General Funston was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" href="#Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
glad to meet the Broncho Rider Boys, especially
after Lieutenant Grant told him in a few words of
the good work they had done on the border and
on the day that Vera Cruz was taken.</p>

<p>"And when do you expect to return to the United
States?" asked the general.</p>

<p>"Just as soon as we can obtain passage," replied
Donald.</p>

<p>"I think we can arrange that for you in a few
days," replied the general. "In the meantime come
in occasionally."</p>

<p>The boys thanked him and started to leave, when
the telephone in the general's quarters rang. He
looked for some one to answer, but no one being
at hand, he picked up the 'phone himself.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked after a brief moment.
"The water works. You think they are attempting
to cut you off. All right, I'll rush help."</p>

<p>He set down the 'phone and turned to Lieutenant
Grant.</p>

<p>"The enemy has gathered in force about the
water works," he said sharply. "They evidently
intend cutting off the water supply. Tell Colonel
Bright to send them reinforcements at once. Do
you boys know the way there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," from all three.</p>

<p>"Then show the men the nearest way! Now
go! The safety of the city may depend upon you!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>AN UNUSUAL RIDING PARTY.</h3>


<p>Flinging themselves into the saddle, the boys
rode rapidly after Lieutenant Grant and were at
Colonel Bright's quarters by the time the bugle
had called to boots and saddle. In another minute,
at the head of a squadron of cavalry, they
dashed over the road they had come to know so
well.</p>

<p>What happened during the next twenty minutes
is history.</p>

<p>Guided by the boys, the reinforcements arrived
opportunely to stop the advance of a large body of
Mexicans who would have destroyed the water
works and have left the inhabitants and the American
troops entirely without water.</p>

<p>A few minutes later two batteries with rapid-fire
guns put in an appearance, and in less time than
it takes to tell it, the Mexicans turned and fled.</p>

<p>It was not General Funston's mission in Vera
Cruz to overrun any more Mexican territory, so
the Mexicans were allowed to retreat without pursuit;
but the lines were strengthened so that from
that time on there was never any danger from
Huerta's forces, although there were numerous
alarms and plenty of scout duty.</p>

<p>During the few minutes of fighting, the boys were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" href="#Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in the midst of it and all came through it without
a scratch. But it was exciting work and when it
was over they were publicly thanked by Colonel
Bright for their good work.</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Billie as the three rode slowly
back to their home, "that's glory enough for one
day. I don't care to be a soldier."</p>

<p>"Nor I!" agreed Donald. "I prefer a quiet life
on the ranch."</p>

<p>"Which we are in a fair way to see in a few
weeks," commented Adrian. "I have no doubt
that General Funston will do as he agreed and find
us passage."</p>

<p>"I for one shall be glad to return to the States,"
said Donald.</p>

<p>"So shall I after I have found out about Santiago's
connection with that ten thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"That's right," was the laughing rejoinder.
"Stick to it, Billie, and who knows what may
happen?"</p>

<p>"Do you know," remarked Adrian slowly, "I'm
beginning to be considerably worried for the Americans
scattered throughout Mexico."</p>

<p>"Why should you be?" from Donald.</p>

<p>"I remember Pedro's words that, if the United
States did anything, Carranza would unite with
Huerta."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he would."</p>

<p>"Maybe not. But the Zapata brothers will think
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" href="#Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
this a good time to make the Americans trouble.
I was thinking of Mr. Black and Josie."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you were," laughed Billie. "I wouldn't
be surprised if they were thinking about you. Hey,
Don?"</p>

<p>"Well, they might do worse," said Donald.
"There are worse fellows than Adrian."</p>

<p>"That's right," retorted Adrian good-humoredly.
"I can stand it. But, just the same, I wish I knew
they were safe."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter with our paying them
a visit?" queried Billie.</p>

<p>"Nix," from Donald. "We'll stay inside the
lines. I've had enough of this bush fighting."</p>

<p>They approached Santiago's residence, where
they had decided to remain until they sailed, when
they perceived a peon on a pony standing by the
gate. As they drew near they recognized him as
one of the peons who had served as Mr. Black's
mozo.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Jos&eacute;!" exclaimed Donald. "What
brings you here?"</p>

<p>The mozo drew a letter from beneath his poncho
and handed it to Donald.</p>

<p>"For me?" asked Donald. "I thought it must
be for Adrian. I didn't think the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is from the jefe," interrupted the mozo.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's from Mr. Black!" with an accent on the
Mr. "That's different."</p>

<p>Donald opened the letter and read it hastily.</p>

<p>"Well, by George!" he exclaimed, "what do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" href="#Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
think of that?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you better when I know what that
is," replied Billie.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Black is becoming alarmed over the
activities of the Carranza forces and wants us to
ask General Funston if he won't send out enough
cavalry to escort him and his daughter to Vera Cruz
in safety."</p>

<p>"Of course we'll ask him!" exclaimed Adrian.
"Let's do it at once."</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute," said Donald. "Let's see
about it."</p>

<p>"What is there to see?"</p>

<p>"There's a good deal to see. You remember
our experiences on the Rio Grande?"</p>

<p>"But this is different! We are at war with Mexico
now."</p>

<p>"No, we are not. We have simply seized one
port as a reprisal. To send a cavalry force out
into the country might bring on more trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care!" exclaimed Adrian hotly.
"I'll go and ask him alone if you are afraid to go
with me. I'm not going to leave Jos&mdash;I mean Mr.
Black and his daughter out there at the mercies of
these greasers. You hear me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll go with you, all right!" said Billie.
"But don't be surprised if you don't get what you
ask."</p>

<p>Accordingly the trio started for General Funston's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" href="#Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
headquarters. After some delay they were
admitted to his presence and Donald showed him
Mr. Black's letter.</p>

<p>The general perused it carefully and then remained
silently thoughtful for some moments.</p>

<p>"I wish I could do what our countryman asks,"
he finally said, "but I do not see how I can. To
send a force out nearly fifty miles, even for such
a service, would be overstepping the purpose for
which I am here. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't leave them out there to be
mistreated and perhaps killed, would you?" interrupted
Adrian.</p>

<p>The general smiled.</p>

<p>"Such is not my intention; but we must plan
some other way. We must use a little strategy."</p>

<p>"That's right!" exclaimed Billie, "and I'll bet
the man who went out and rounded up Aguinaldo
will know how to do it!"</p>

<p>Again the general smiled broadly, evidently well
pleased at the implied compliment.</p>

<p>"I'll do the best I can," he said quietly, "but I
am not very familiar with the lay of the land. You
boys have had some experience. Perhaps you can
suggest something."</p>

<p>Adrian said nothing, and Donald scratched his
head. It was Billie who spoke.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering, General," he said, "if
some of the men wouldn't like to take a little horseback
ride and see something of the country."</p>

<p>"Well, now, perhaps they might," assented the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" href="#Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
general.</p>

<p>"We could show them some mighty fine scenery,
sir."</p>

<p>"By the moonlight, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. By the moonlight and early sunrise."</p>

<p>"And about how many would you like to take
on this picnic?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Billie, squinting up one eye, "I
was thinking that Adrian and I might take out
about ten to-night. Then about the same time
to-morrow night Don could take another ten. We
would probably meet somewhere in the mountains
and watch the sun rise."</p>

<p>"A very nice plan," said the general, "and one
of which I approve. You may ask Lieutenant Grant
to make enquiries among the men in his company
and see if there are any who would like to be
given two or three days' leave for such a purpose."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir!" and Billie touched his hat in
true military style.</p>

<p>"And you might say to the lieutenant," was General
Funston's parting words, "that I should be glad
to hear later how the men enjoyed their ride. I
think, now that the boys are down here, they should
be given a chance to see the country."</p>

<p>"Billie, you have the making of a great general,"
was Donald's comment as they left the general's
quarters. "How did you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I remembered my experience when I wanted men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" href="#Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
to help me get you and Ad out of trouble in Presidio.
Lieutenant Grant will know all about it."</p>

<p>And so he did. In less than half an hour ten
regulars, some of them but very little older than
Billie and Adrian, were ready for the ride which
Billie had proposed and which in his mind would be
as far as Moreno.</p>

<p>"You are sure ten will be enough?" asked Lieutenant
Grant.</p>

<p>"Sure! Twelve Americans are enough to lick
fifty Mexicans if it comes to that; and besides we
shall have Mr. Black and Josie. He's as good as
four."</p>

<p>"And don't forget the reinforcements, if they are
needed," laughed Donald. "We will be right on
the spot where we saw the sun rise the first morning
after we left Moreno."</p>

<p>"It looks all right," was Lieutenant Grant's comment,
"but it is always well to have a big enough
force. Success to you!"</p>

<p>"You'll make all the necessary explanations to
the crowd you bring out, Don," was Billie's parting
words. "Adrian and I will explain the nature
of the trip to our fellows as we ride along."</p>

<p>This they did, and gave the soldier boys a little
history of their own troubles in reaching Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>"No explanations are necessary," remarked a
young chap by the name of Brooks, a corporal.
"We saw you out at the water works and we know
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" href="#Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
you are made of the right stuff. You lead! We'll
follow, won't we, boys?"</p>

<p>"You bet!" replied the others in one voice.</p>

<h3>ADRIAN FOILS A TRAITOR.</h3>


<p>It was nine o'clock of the second night that
Adrian and Billie, accompanied by Mr. Black's
mozo, Jos&eacute;, and the ten troopers, reached the outskirts
of Moreno.</p>

<p>They had made good headway the first night,
had slept in the hills during the day and had come
this far without molestation.</p>

<p>"If everything goes to the end as it has this far,"
remarked Corporal Brooks to Billie as they neared
the little town, "it will be nothing but a pleasant
outing, sure enough."</p>

<p>Arriving at the edge of the town, the boys sent
Jos&eacute; forward to see how the land lay and to bring
them word.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can trust him?" asked the
corporal.</p>

<p>"We'll have to," replied Adrian. "I believe he is
loyal, and Mr. Black seems to have complete confidence
in him."</p>

<p>"Let's hope so, anyway," said Billie. "It seems
to be the best we can do to get word to Mr. Black
of our presence."</p>

<p>"Hurry back, Jos&eacute;," urged Adrian as the mozo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" href="#Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
departed.</p>

<p>"Si, se&ntilde;or," was the brief reply. "You may depend
on me."</p>

<p>"It ought not to take him more than half an
hour," explained Billie. "It isn't more than a
mile."</p>

<p>But a half hour passed and then another and
still no Jos&eacute;.</p>

<p>"Something must have happened to him," said
Adrian.</p>

<p>"That's the charitable way to look at it," laughed
the corporal. "It's more likely, however, that he's
making arrangements to have something happen
to us."</p>

<p>"I hardly think so," was Billie's comment, "but,
if he is, we'll fool him."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We'll move."</p>

<p>"But he may come back."</p>

<p>"We'll leave one man here on guard. The rest
of us will go around to the other side of town."</p>

<p>"Good!" from the corporal. "You are a strategist."</p>

<p>The plan was at once carried into effect.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Billie, "I'm going in to town
myself."</p>

<p>"Not much," declared Adrian. "I'm going."</p>

<p>"I'd offer to go myself," laughed the corporal,
"but I don't know the place."</p>

<p>"We'll toss for it," said Billie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" href="#Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," and Adrian produced a coin.
"Heads I win. Tails you lose."</p>

<p>"No funny business," said Billie. "Choose heads
if you want."</p>

<p>Adrian flipped the coin. It came down heads
up.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Billie. "Now for some set
of signals."</p>

<p>"Our old Broncho Rider whistle if I need help,"
said Adrian. "If everything is O. K., I'll give the
whip-poor-will."</p>

<p>Adrian slid from his horse.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Billie.</p>

<p>"I'm going afoot. I didn't spend my boyhood
among the Indians for nothing. Good-bye!" and a
moment later he disappeared in the fading moonlight.</p>

<p>"Whatever the conditions," said Billie, "we'll
soon know," as he settled back in his saddle.</p>

<p>Running swiftly along, Adrian made straight for
the barracks in which he knew would be found
whatever soldiers might be in the city.</p>

<p>"If I find everything quiet at the barracks," was
his thought, "I can go straight to where Mr. Black
is stopping without fear. If I find there is any
disturbance, I'll be more careful."</p>

<p>Ten minutes of running brought him to the barracks.
All was as quiet as the hour demanded. He
stood under the shadow of the back wall long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" href="#Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
enough to hear the sentry's call and then he turned
in the direction of the house where the two Americans
were stopping.</p>

<p>It was only a few blocks away and he reached
it without incident.</p>

<p>"Kind o' funny," he mused, "that I haven't seen
or heard a soul on the street. I wonder what's become
of Jos&eacute;?"</p>

<p>He stopped a minute to ponder.</p>

<p>"Things are going almost too smooth. I'll just
stop a bit."</p>

<p>He stole past the house and a moment later threw
himself into the gutter, where he lay as one dead.</p>

<p>The wisdom of his action soon became apparent.</p>

<p>He hadn't been lying there two minutes until
a solitary figure passed him and stopped in front of
the house, evidently listening to hear what might
be going on inside.</p>

<p>A moment later he was joined by another figure.
Adrian could just make them out in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Have they come?" was the whispered question.</p>

<p>"I can't tell," was the whispered reply.</p>

<p>Adrian heard both the question and the answer
distinctly.</p>

<p>"It's Jos&eacute;," he said to himself. "He knew that
it was the plan for Billie and I both to come to
the house. The traitor! I have a notion to shoot
him in his tracks."</p>

<p>Only the fear of creating a disturbance kept the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" href="#Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
lad from carrying out his notion.</p>

<p>"Why don't you knock and tell the Gringo you
are here?" was the next question.</p>

<p>"They might be in there."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that? You can tell them you
were stopped by the guard and have just been released.
That'll seem reasonable."</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; stepped to the door and knocked.</p>

<p>There was no response and he knocked again.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>"Jos&eacute;. I just come from Vera Cruz. Let me in."</p>

<p>There was a movement within and presently the
door opened and Jos&eacute; entered, closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p>Adrian slowly arose to a kneeling posture.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the other will do now?" he
wondered.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait, for the other
knocked on the pavement with his gun and presently
several more figures appeared. Adrian had
just time to throw himself to the ground and escape
detection.</p>

<p>The men in front of the house exchanged whispered
confidences and then all but one started to
leave.</p>

<p>"If any one attempts to leave the house," was
the command, "fire! If any one attempts to enter,
allow them to do so and then give the customary
call."</p>

<p>"Bueno!" was the response, and all but the one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" href="#Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
withdrew.</p>

<p>A minute later Adrian again arose to a crouching
posture and as the sentry cautiously approached
the door, he crept up behind him. An instant more
and he was upon the man and had him by the
throat.</p>

<p>The man was a wiry Mexican and evidently in
training, for he squirmed and kicked vigorously;
but Adrian's grip was too firm upon him and in a
couple of minutes he sank down limp upon the
ground.</p>

<p>The noise of the scuffle must have been heard
inside, for the door cautiously opened and a head
peered out.</p>

<p>Without a question Adrian sprang within, dragging
the lifeless form of the sentry with him.</p>

<p>"Quick, bar the gate!" he commanded.</p>

<p>The command was obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now where is Mr. Black?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Upstairs talking with Jos&eacute;."</p>

<p>"All right. Bind this man while I go up. Don't
let him escape or he is liable to cut your throat."</p>

<p>"<i>No temer V, se&ntilde;or</i>" was the response, meaning
"Have no fear."</p>

<p>Adrian ran lightly up the stairs, revolver in hand.
He heard voices talking and had no doubt that
Jos&eacute; was narrating some trumped-up story.</p>

<p>"Yes, se&ntilde;or," he heard the mozo say, "they are
expecting you. It is necessary that you go at once."</p>

<p>Adrian flung open the door and covered Jos&eacute;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" href="#Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
with his revolver.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands," he commanded. Then to
Mr. Black, to whom Jos&eacute; was talking: "Take his
weapons away from him, Mr. Black."</p>

<p>Realizing at once that something was wrong, Mr.
Black obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now tie him."</p>

<p>This was also quickly done, Mr. Black asking at
the same time what had happened.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you exactly, Mr. Black, but this
man has betrayed us and we are now watched by
a squad of soldiers."</p>

<p>Mr. Black's face turned as black as his name.</p>

<p>"Is that true?" he demanded, seizing Jos&eacute; by
the shoulder with such a powerful grip that the
man cried out with pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, se&ntilde;or," he cried, "don't kill me! I will
tell you all."</p>

<p>"See that you do," was the command. "One lie
and I will wring your neck as I would a chicken.
You know me."</p>

<p>"I'll tell the truth. I told the captain at the barracks.
He is going to capture all the Americanos
and hold them for ransom and I am to have half."</p>

<p>"That is evidently the truth," declared Adrian,
and he proceeded to tell Mr. Black what was being
done to get him and his daughter to Vera Cruz,
and how Jos&eacute; had played them false.</p>

<p>For a moment it looked as though Mr. Black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" href="#Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
might wreak his vengeance on Jos&eacute;, but after a
minute he thought better of it.</p>

<p>"You ought to die this minute," he declared, "but
I'll wait till I have more time." Then to Adrian:
"What had we better do now?"</p>

<p>Before Adrian could reply the clear note of a
bugle rang out upon the night air.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>ADRIAN HAS AN ACCIDENT.</h3>


<p>"What do you suppose that means?" asked
Adrian.</p>

<p>Mr. Black made no reply and a moment later
the bugle call was repeated.</p>

<p>"It sounds to me," said Mr. Black, "as though
some fresh troops were coming in."</p>

<p>"That's bad," was Adrian's comment.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, my lad, if we act quickly."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"The new arrivals may take up the attention of
the gang of bandits outside and we may get away
ere they return."</p>

<p>"Good," was Adrian's comment. "Where is Miss
Josie?"</p>

<p>"Waiting in the next room with the family of
my host."</p>

<p>Mr. Black stepped to the door and called to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" href="#Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
those within. In a few words he explained the
situation and in less than three minutes he and
the girl were mounted and ready to ride.</p>

<p>"Where is your horse?" he asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"I left it with the boys at the cocoanut grove."</p>

<p>"But we can't go and leave you here."</p>

<p>"Of course not. I shall run alongside of your
horse, holding to its mane, Indian fashion. Now
then, are we ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready!"</p>

<p>The great gate was opened noiselessly and, bidding
a subdued good-bye to the family, the three
passed out into the night.</p>

<p>"I should have throttled Jos&eacute; ere I left," declared
Mr. Black as they passed down the street.</p>

<p>"I wish we were as safe as he is," laughed
Adrian.</p>

<p>For three blocks they wended their way as silently
as possible and just as they came out into
the open there came another bugle call.</p>

<p>"That's for us," said Adrian. "There is no
mistaking that command. Now to run for it."</p>

<p>The two riders put spurs to their horses and
Adrian bounded along at their side, running as
lightly as an antelope. They were rapidly nearing
the spot where the Americans were in waiting, when
Adrian stepped into a hole and pitched forward
onto his face.</p>

<p>"Don't stop for me!" he called. "I'll be there as
quick as you are!"</p>

<p>He picked himself up and started to run, but his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" href="#Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
ankle gave him such a pain that he almost fainted.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" he exclaimed, "I've sprained my
ankle."</p>

<p>He sat down and rubbed the maimed member
for a couple of minutes and then attempted to hobble
on. It was more than he could bear and he
sat down again.</p>

<p>"By George," he groaned, "this is tough! I'll
have to call for help."</p>

<p>He gave the well-known whistle, but there was
no response.</p>

<p>He gave it again; but still no answer.</p>

<p>"Worse and more of it," he muttered. "Something
has happened to Billie."</p>

<p>What it might be Adrian could not imagine, but
he was sure that his chum was not at the appointed
spot, as he was near enough to have heard the
whistle and would surely have answered.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't stay here. The greasers will be
coming pretty soon. I must get along some way."</p>

<p>He got up and walked a few steps and again sat
down. There was no sound of a pursuit and the
hoofbeats of Mr. Black's horses had ceased.</p>

<p>"They have reached the grove," Adrian muttered.
"I must get there some way."</p>

<p>Once more he arose to his feet and took several
steps and then sank down in a faint, so great was
the pain.</p>

<p>When he came to himself he was lying upon a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" href="#Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
matting of some kind and to his ears came the
faint sound of a guitar, followed a few moments
later by sounds of girlish laughter.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked around, but could see nothing,
except a ray of light coming in through a little
crack between a couple of blankets that formed a
curtain in a doorway.</p>

<p>"Where in the name of common sense am I?"
he muttered.</p>

<p>He attempted to get to his feet, but the pain in
his ankle brought him quickly to himself.</p>

<p>"Now I remember!" he exclaimed. "I fell and
sprained my ankle. But how did I get here?"</p>

<p>He started to call, but at that moment the music
ceased and a minute later he heard voices saying
good night. Then a door was closed and immediately
the curtains were thrown open and a peon
woman stood in the door.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, upon seeing Adrian sitting
up and looking at her. "Then you are not
dead?"</p>

<p>"I should say not. Did you think I was?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid so."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because your death might be laid at my door."</p>

<p>"Evidently she hasn't discovered I am an American,"
thought Adrian. "Well, I'll not tell her until
I have to."</p>

<p>The woman turned around and called to some one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" href="#Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in the other room and another figure appeared in
the door&mdash;that of a girl some fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>"Look, Peppita," and the elder woman pointed
at Adrian.</p>

<p>The girl gave a little scream.</p>

<p>"<i>Madre mia!</i>" she exclaimed. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"I know not, my child. I found him unconscious
at our back door and dragged him inside."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Adrian. "I didn't
know I was near any house."</p>

<p>"It is a very poor one, se&ntilde;or. I and my daughter
are all alone since my poor Leocadio was killed."</p>

<p>"Who killed him?" asked Adrian, becoming interested.</p>

<p>"The Huertistas. He was a soldier under Gen.
Dorantes."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" exclaimed Adrian. "I know Gen.
Dorantes well. He is a fine man. But you will
soon be avenged, for Huerta's days are short."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes snapped.</p>

<p>"<i>Es verdad?</i>" meaning, "Is it true?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is. Since the Americans have taken
Vera Cruz, Gen. Huerta will have to go. It is
only a question of a few days."</p>

<p>"<i>Bienissimo!</i> The Americans are brave men!
My Leocadio was fond of the Americans."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, se&ntilde;ora, for I am an American."</p>

<p>The woman and girl both started back as in fear
and then came forward again.</p>

<p>"How did you come here, se&ntilde;or?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" href="#Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fell from a horse and sprained my ankle. I
tried to walk and must have fainted."</p>

<p>"Have you friends in Moreno?"</p>

<p>"I did have, but they have gone and I want to
get to Vera Cruz."</p>

<p>"Vera Cruz is a long way, se&ntilde;or. I never expect
to go that far from home&mdash;me and my little Peppa."</p>

<p>Adrian smiled.</p>

<p>"I expect it does look like a long ways to you,
se&ntilde;ora; but it is not far. Do you think I can stay
here with you until my ankle is well enough to
walk? I have a little money. I will pay you something."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother!" exclaimed the girl, who now
spoke for the first time. "You will let him stay,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"The wife of Leocadio would not turn a lame
dog out, much less a lame boy."</p>

<p>"<i>Mil gracias, se&ntilde;ora!</i>" exclaimed Adrian, with
much gratitude. "Yes, more than a thousand
thanks. You will never regret it."</p>

<p>"The wife of Leocadio is not learned," was the
reply, "but she knows an honest youth when she
sees one. Come, Peppita, let the young man go
to sleep. We will make our bed out here."</p>

<p>She drew the curtains together and Adrian was
left alone to his own reflections.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed under his breath,
"if I ever get out of this measly country, I'll be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" href="#Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
glad. I wonder what has become of Billie? Of
course he'll look for me, and old Don, too; but
it looks as though it might be weeks before I could
walk. Well, I don't care. If Mr. Black and Josie
got away, that's glory enough for one day."</p>

<p>He settled himself down and tried to go to sleep,
but his leg hurt him so that he could not. In
fact, the pain was so great that every once in a
while he groaned.</p>

<p>After a few of these groans the woman appeared
in the door with an earthen vessel filled with hot
water.</p>

<p>"If the se&ntilde;or will bind this on his ankle, it will
do it much good," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll do anything to get rid of this pain," said
Adrian.</p>

<p>He took the jar and, dipping his handkerchief
in it, bathed his ankle freely and finally bound the
cloth around the swollen part.</p>

<p>"There," he muttered as he at last succeeded
in finding a comfortable position, "now I think I
can get a little sleep."</p>

<p>How long thereafter it was before he came
to himself he did not know, but when he opened his
eyes the first streak of daylight was creeping in
through a little window.</p>

<p>A minute later there was the rattle of musketry,
followed by a hearty American cheer. He raised
up to look out of the window, when the side of the
room came in with a crash.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>A RESCUE AND A SURPRISE.</h3>


<p>It would be hard to describe Adrian's surprise
at the unexpected event which closed the preceding
chapter. His first thought was that a cannon ball
had struck the house, but a second thought convinced
him that such was not the case. Before
he had time to think further he heard a big voice
call out:</p>

<p>"Here he is!"</p>

<p>A moment later Mr. Black burst in through the
opening in the wall and, picking Adrian up in his
arms as though he had been a baby, started on a
run with him for the nearest horse.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he exclaimed as he set the
boy on the horse. "Now to run for it!"</p>

<p>Adrian needed no second bidding, but digging
his heels into the horse's side he dashed away toward
the cocoanut grove, his flight being protected
by the Americans with Billie at their head.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes after, the entire band had
rallied in the shelter of the trees, where they stopped
to plan for the next move.</p>

<p>"How did you ever find me?" asked Adrian as
he and Billie peered out toward the town.</p>

<p>"Mr. Black knew about where he lost you and
we tracked you by your trail. Whoever dragged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" href="#Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
you into the house, left a trail as wide as your
body."</p>

<p>"It was a woman," explained Adrian, "and she
was hiding me. But where were you when I whistled
for help?"</p>

<p>"That's a long story," was the reply, "which I
will tell you when we have time; but briefly we
were on the other side of the town, where we left
the man on guard. It appears that our friend Jos&eacute;
was a first-class traitor."</p>

<p>"As I discovered," said Adrian.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Billie, "he sent a bunch of soldiers
to capture us. The sentry heard them coming
and gave the alarm. We went to his aid and
succeeded in rescuing him, but that is what got
us into this trouble."</p>

<p>"And now what?"</p>

<p>"Now we have to get away just as soon as we
can."</p>

<p>"Right," said Mr. Black. "There is no enemy
in sight at this moment and the best thing we can
do is to run for it. If we can cross the valley
safely, we shall have little trouble."</p>

<p>"I'd like to stay and give them a few shots,"
said the corporal, "but it would probably be unwise."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Brooks," suggested Billie,
"suppose you and I remain behind until we see
the others well across the valley. If there is any
pursuit, we can hold them back for a few minutes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" href="#Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
They will not know how many we are and
it will give the others a chance to escort Mr. Black
and his daughter to a place of safety. You know
that is what we really came for."</p>

<p>"Fine!" was the corporal's reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Black and Adrian protested, but they were
overruled.</p>

<p>"It's a good idea," said the oldest of the troopers,
"and now to run for it."</p>

<p>It was fully five minutes after the others had
left that Billie and Brooks saw the Mexican infantry,
some fifty in number, emerge from the town
and come slowly toward them.</p>

<p>Looking across the valley, they could perceive
that the little band under the direction of Mr.
Black was nearing the protection of the forest that
covered the next hillside.</p>

<p>"Two minutes more and they will be safe," said
Billie.</p>

<p>"Then we'll give them the two minutes," replied
the corporal. "Cut loose at the bunch as soon as
it is near enough."</p>

<p>A moment later two rifles spoke out and then
they turned loose their automatics, to give the impression
of a much larger force.</p>

<p>Two men fell and a minute later two more, as
the boys' Winchesters again spoke.</p>

<p>"Now for the horses!" cried Billie as the Mexicans
threw themselves upon the ground.</p>

<p>They sprang to their horses and dashed away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" href="#Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
down the valley.</p>

<p>They were not discovered until they had cleared
the shelter of the trees and then a volley was fired
after them. The bullets sang all around them, but
they escaped unhurt, and before another volley
they were out of range.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for us that they have no
cavalry," said Brooks as they sped along.</p>

<p>"Sure is," was the response, "and I hope they
don't succeed in getting word ahead of us."</p>

<p>"We'll fix that," said Brooks. "We cross the
railroad just at the foot of the hill and I'll climb
up and cut the telegraph wires."</p>

<p>"They may have sent word already."</p>

<p>"Hardly. They may have tried to, but it's dollars
to doughnuts that there was nobody at Joachin or
Rio Blanco to receive it. The nearest night operator,
I imagine, is at Piedras Negras."</p>

<p>"They may send a force from there to head us
off," suggested Billie.</p>

<p>"That's so; but I'm not sure whether Piedras
Negras is held by the Carranza or the Huerta
forces."</p>

<p>"It's a terrible mix-up, isn't it?" laughed Billie.
"But I guess either side would be glad to
get us."</p>

<p>They had reached the tracks by this time and a
couple of minutes later Brooks was up a pole and
with the aid of his bayonet broke the wires.</p>

<p>"If it isn't too late, that'll hold 'em for a while,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" href="#Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
he remarked as he descended from the pole and
mounted his horse.</p>

<p>When they joined the main company, Billie told
Mr. Black what they had done and repeated to him
what Brooks had said.</p>

<p>"I think he is right," said Mr. Black, "and my
advice is that we should give Piedras Negras a
wide berth."</p>

<p>"We can't get too far away from the railroad,"
explained Billie, "or we shall miss Don and his
company. They are coming out for just such an
emergency."</p>

<p>They rode rapidly forward for a couple of hours
and then, turning sharply off the highway, took to
the woods which now grew dense all along the
mountain sides.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock they stopped for breakfast
and then all took a nap until the sun drew near
the western horizon.</p>

<p>"We should reach our rendezvous with Don about
dark," explained Billie, "and that would get us
into Vera Cruz about daylight."</p>

<p>As they approached the appointed spot, Billie
and Adrian, ever on the alert, noticed almost as
one that the place had a changed appearance and
mentioned it to the others.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the corporal.</p>

<p>"I can't exactly explain," was Adrian's reply,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" href="#Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
"but my prairie training always warns me to go
slow when I sense danger."</p>

<p>"A mighty good idea," muttered one of the
troopers, an old campaigner who had seen service
with Funston in the Philippines. "These are slippery
chaps."</p>

<p>"If I could walk," was Adrian's comment, "I'd
soon find out what is wrong; but you can't scout
on horseback."</p>

<p>The cavalcade came to a halt and the men examined
their weapons to be sure they were in
order.</p>

<p>"What do you think we'd better do, Ad?" queried
Billie.</p>

<p>"I don't know. How far are we from the rendezvous?"</p>

<p>"Not more than half a mile."</p>

<p>"If it were not for the possibility of making matters
worse," suggested Adrian, "I'd fire a few shots;
but of course what we want is to get into Vera
Cruz without a fight. What do you think, Mr.
Black?"</p>

<p>"This is new business to me, boys," was the
reply. "I'll have to leave it to you."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with my going on a scout?"
asked Billie.</p>

<p>"Nothing the matter with your going," laughed
Adrian, "but there might be with your coming
back. No, I shall have to go, ankle or no ankle."</p>

<p>He slid from his horse, and almost before any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" href="#Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
one realized what he was doing he had slipped
away on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>"He is certainly a brave boy," was Josie's remark,
"and I hate to think of his taking all this
risk on my account."</p>

<p>"Not so much risk for him as for us, I'm thinking,"
muttered the old trooper. "They are looking
for mounted men&mdash;if they're looking at all&mdash;and
not for crawling boys."</p>

<p>The old trooper was right, and ten minutes later
Adrian returned to say that there was a small body
of horsemen at the next turn of the road.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything of Don?" queried Billie.</p>

<p>"Not a sign."</p>

<p>"That's mighty funny. Where do you suppose he
can be?"</p>

<p>"He may be hiding back in the woods, just as we
are."</p>

<p>"Well," said the corporal, "now that we know
where the greasers are, what's the matter of going
forward?"</p>

<p>"No matter at all," replied Adrian. "We can
easily bear away to the left and give them the
shake, but I don't know what to do about the
others."</p>

<p>"The others will have to look out for themselves,"
replied Brooks. "They are able to do
it."</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips ere there came
the sound of a single shot away to the left.</p>

<p>"There they are!" cried Billie. "Come on!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" href="#Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>The little cavalcade started forward, but ere they
had gone a dozen rods they could hear the sound of
approaching horsemen, crashing through the woods
to their right.</p>

<p>"The Mexicans!" said Adrian.</p>

<p>"To cover, every man!" cried the corporal.</p>

<p>A minute later every horse lay flat on the ground
with his rider concealed behind him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>A DINNER AND ITS RESULT.</h3>


<p>With a shout the Mexicans broke into the clearing
which the Americans had just left. They were
a motley crowd, not much like the cavalry that
forms such a great part of Uncle Sam's army.</p>

<p>"It seems a shame to hurt them," muttered the
corporal. "They look as though they would run
if you said boo!"</p>

<p>Seeing no one, the Mexicans, some twenty or
twenty-five in number, came to a halt and their
leaders held a council of war.</p>

<p>The Americans, a couple of rods back in the
woods, partly concealed by the trees and partly by
the deepening twilight, watched them silently.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes' confab, the captain
of the band gave an order which the boys could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" href="#Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
not hear and a couple of Mexicans dismounted
and began carefully to examine the ground. They
were looking for the prints of horses' hoofs.</p>

<p>"<i>Aqui'sta!</i>" exclaimed one of the men on foot,
pointing to the ground.</p>

<p>The captain drew near and leaned over from his
horse to see more clearly.</p>

<p>He was evidently satisfied, for he straightened
up and gave another command and the two horsemen
sprang to their saddles.</p>

<p>Another command and every man's sabre flashed
in the air.</p>

<p>Raising his own sabre aloft, the captain was
about to give another command, when there was
the sound of a single shot from the rear and the
captain's sabre went flying from his hand, struck
by a rifle ball.</p>

<p>"<i>Carramba!</i>" he cried. "<i>Emboscado!</i>" meaning
"an ambush," and putting spurs to his horse he
turned and fled in the direction from which he
had come, followed by the entire band, while the
Americans fired a volley into the air.</p>

<p>"They'll never stop running," laughed the corporal,
"until they reach home&mdash;wherever that is."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime we'll get out of here,"
said Mr. Black.</p>

<p>The men sprang to their feet and to their horses.
At the same moment there came from the woods
to the left the well-known whistle of the Broncho
Rider Boys.</p>

<p>"It's Don!" cried Billie, as he gave the answering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" href="#Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
call, and an instant later Donald came into
view through the trees, closely followed by half
a score of Uncle Sam's troopers.</p>

<p>"Just too late," said Adrian.</p>

<p>"Too late for what?" queried Donald.</p>

<p>"To see a masterly retreat," and in a few words
he told Donald what had occurred.</p>

<p>"Well," was the rejoinder, "I am glad no blood
was shed. But who fired the shot from the rear?"</p>

<p>"I," came a voice, and out of the shadows appeared
a figure which had a most familiar appearance.
"If you don't recognize me," he continued,
"you may recognize Ambrosio."</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Billie, "if it isn't our
old friend Strong. Where on earth did you come
from?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I might ask you the same thing,"
was the laughing reply. "Briefly, I am on my way
to Vera Cruz. I heard there was a band of American
brigands out in the mountains and I thought
I might fall in with them."</p>

<p>"So that's what they call us, is it?" said Billie.
"I never expected to be called a brigand."</p>

<p>"Strange things happen to men who travel," declared
Strong facetiously; "but you'd better be going.
There are some good troops in this section
and they are on the lookout."</p>

<p>"Good advice," muttered the old trooper. "This
ain't no pleasure excursion."</p>

<p>"Sorry we haven't a horse for you," said Adrian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" href="#Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to Strong, "but I guess you are used to walking."</p>

<p>"A good deal more so than riding. But, if one
of you don't mind giving Ambrosio a lift, it will
help some."</p>

<p>Several expressed their willingness to take the
ape on behind, but he would go to no one but
Billie.</p>

<p>"All right, old man," laughed the boy; "but no
funny business," and he broke off a twig and shook
it at Ambrosio. "You see this."</p>

<p>Now that the two companies had united, they
broke away from the railroad and made a bee line
toward Vera Cruz, arriving in sight of the city
at daybreak.</p>

<p>"Here's where we part company with the troopers,"
explained Donald. "We six and Ambrosio
will ride into town together and the boys will come
in as they wish. There must be no suggestion of
a military expedition."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Black, "and I want to thank
you all for your kindness to my daughter and to
me. That is about all I can do now. Perhaps some
day I can do more."</p>

<p>"That's enough," muttered the old trooper, "unless
you can get us all sent back home. I can't
see any use of keeping us here."</p>

<p>"That's all right, old man," laughed the corporal.
"You know you would not go home if you
could."</p>

<p>"Better not give me a chance," was the grumbling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" href="#Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
reply, as the trooper bit off a big piece of
tobacco and tucked it away in his cheek.</p>

<p>Reveille was just sounding when the boys, accompanied
by their three friends and Ambrosio,
perched upon Billie's horse, drew up in front of
Lieut. Grant's quarters. They had been recognized
and passed through the lines, and as the men caught
sight of them they were given a hearty cheer.</p>

<p>"You seem to have made friends," laughed the
lieutenant as he greeted them, "and there is every
reason why you should. The general will be glad
to see you and hear your report. I have no doubt
you have a good story to tell, and he likes a good
story."</p>

<p>When the boys reached home they found the gate
still locked, although it was now considerably past
the time when the household was astir. Their knock
was answered by the <i>portero</i>, who, in response to a
question by Billie, said that Santiago was seriously
ill and had been for thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Fever."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," declared Adrian. "The
strange thoughts he has been thinking so many
days were bound to result in something serious."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not convenient for us to remain
here," said Mr. Black. "We can, I am sure, find
some other place."</p>

<p>But at this moment Lucia appeared at the head
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" href="#Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of the stairs. When made acquainted with Mr.
Black's words she would not hear of his taking
Josie to any other house and gave orders for making
her perfectly at home. The only one who did
not remain was Strong.</p>

<p>"I'll come back this evening," he said. "I have
a strange story to tell you boys and I may need
your help in locating a man I am most anxious to
find."</p>

<p>But he did not come back that evening, and when
he did come the next night the boys were not
there, having been invited to dine with Gen. Funston.
Had things not happened thus, a part of
this story could never have been written, for it
was while dining with the general that the boys
were given a duty to perform, which was the most
arduous of all their adventures in the land of the
Montezumas.</p>

<p>And this was the manner of it.</p>

<p>They were just finishing dinner and Billie was
congratulating himself that he had had his fill of
good American cooking, when an aide announced
that a Mexican gentleman, Don Esteban Mendoza,
craved an immediate audience with Gen. Funston.</p>

<p>"I am sure you young gentlemen will excuse me
a few minutes," said the general, "as Don Esteban
is one of the prominent bankers of the city and I
know his business must be of importance."</p>

<p>The boys were glad to accept the proffered excuse
and the general withdrew, leaving them in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" href="#Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
company of several members of his staff, to whom
they briefly related their recent adventure. When
they told of the "ambush" there was much amusement.</p>

<p>In the midst of their conversation the general
returned accompanied by Don Esteban.</p>

<p>"These are the young gentlemen to whom I referred,"
explained the general, introducing the
boys. "They are typical Americans and, being
civilians and speaking Spanish fluently, will be just
the ones to help you in your trouble."</p>

<p>Then to the boys: "Don Esteban has a very delicate
mission for which he asks the assistance of
Americans. He wished me to detail three young
officers for the work, but this I do not feel I can
do, as it is strictly a private mission. If you feel
that you can undertake it, he will be glad to explain
it to you."</p>

<p>"Anything that you recommend, General, we shall
be glad to undertake," replied Donald, acting as
spokesman for the trio.</p>

<p>"Then I shall turn you over to Don Esteban, and
as his business is pressing, I will excuse you if
you wish to accompany him home."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks, General," said Don Esteban
effusively. Then to the boys: "My automobile is
at the door. If you will take seats in it, we shall
be speedily at my house. You will pardon me if
I speak nothing but Spanish, as I know very little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" href="#Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
English, although"&mdash;with an expressive glance at
Gen. Funston&mdash;"I hope to know it better."</p>

<p>Following Don Esteban, they were soon speeding
through the streets and five minutes later entered
a handsome patio.</p>

<p>"This is my house," said Don Esteban. "Be
pleased to consider it your own. Now, if you will
follow me to the library, I will explain the mission
I wish you to undertake."</p>

<p>The boys followed without a word, but as they
passed up the stairs Billie muttered under his
breath:</p>

<p>"Did you notice, boys, that this house backs right
up against Santiago's?"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>DON ESTEBAN'S STRANGE LOSS.</h3>


<p>"Before I explain to you the mission I wish you
to undertake," said Don Esteban, "I must narrate
briefly a story that has been handed down from
the days of Montezuma. It is to the effect that
when the Spanish conqueror, Cortez, was about
to capture the City of Mexico, most of the treasure
of the Aztecs was sunk in the lake, which at
that time covered a portion of the Mexican plateau.</p>

<p>"A part of this treasure is said to have been recovered,
but the mine from which the gold of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" href="#Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Montezuma was taken has never been discovered,
although search has been made for upward of five
hundred years. Some have supposed that the mine
was adjacent to the City of Mexico and that it
was flooded at the time the treasure was sunk in
the lake. Others have thought it was located in
the state of Michoacan, while still others have believed
it located in the vicinity of Mt. Orizaba.</p>

<p>"My reason for telling you this is that some
years ago a strange appearing man came to our
bank and made a large deposit of money, all in
gold. He did not deposit it all at once, but brought
it in a few thousand dollars at a time until it
amounted to more than a million dollars. Then
he disappeared and we have never seen him since."</p>

<p>"And has he never called for any of the money?"
asked Billie.</p>

<p>"Not in person, although he has drawn upon it
at frequent intervals. The name under which it
was deposited is James Moon."</p>

<p>"An American?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"I could not say whether he was an American
or an Englishman. We took him for the latter.
But now I am coming to the real part of the
story.</p>

<p>"In addition to the money which he deposited,
he also left with us a small brass-bound box, in
which he said there were valuable papers. He gave
orders that it should be delivered to no one but
himself in person, or until the expiration of ten
years. The ten years will be up in a few days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" href="#Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and this afternoon I bethought me of the box.
But when I went into the vault in which it has been
kept for so many years, the place upon an upper
shelf, where it has always stood, was vacant. The
box was gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone?" exclaimed all the boys in unison. "Do
you mean stolen?"</p>

<p>"So it would appear."</p>

<p>"How could it have been done?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"I cannot say; but the strange thing about the
whole matter is that in place of the box, there lay
upon the shelf an envelope&mdash;yellow with age, upon
which was written in ink that had scarcely faded
the words: 'Montezuma's Mine.'"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?" queried Billie,
looking at the others in amazement.</p>

<p>"I don't think," laughed Adrian. "It's up to you
to do the thinking."</p>

<p>"Is there no clue whatever?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Not that could be really called a clue. The
only suspicious thing that has happened to-day at
all, was that a mountebank came into our bank&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A mountebank!" from all.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he have an ape with him?"</p>

<p>"No! He was quite alone. He did not come in
to make merry, but to get a bill changed. While
he was there he was observed to scrutinize the
place very closely."</p>

<p>"But he did not go into your vault?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" href="#Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"No! He took his change and went peaceably
out."</p>

<p>"Then, why should you suspect him?" insisted
Donald, casting a knowing glance at the other boys.</p>

<p>"Because, an hour later, he came in again and
said that one of the bills we gave him as change
was a counterfeit."</p>

<p>"Was it?"</p>

<p>"No, it was not, although it was an old issue.
The teller who waited upon him had no recollection
of ever having seen the bill before, but rather
than have a scene, we gave him another bill for
it."</p>

<p>"How large a bill was it?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"Only a peso"&mdash;that is a dollar&mdash;"and it seemed
hardly worth talking about; but you'd have thought
it was a hundred."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it seemed a large amount to him,"
ventured Billie.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," admitted Don Esteban. "But be that
as it may, I should like to see the man again, and
especially would I like to know where he got that
old dollar."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it may have come out of that box."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Donald, with a shake of his
head, "it might have; but how could the mountebank
have gotten the box?"</p>

<p>"That is the mystery," was Don Esteban's reply.</p>

<p>"And how do you wish us to help you?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" href="#Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Adrian.</p>

<p>"Why," explained the banker, "I asked Gen. Funston
to find the mountebank for me. He said you
boys would do better than any one else."</p>

<p>"But why us? Why not a Mexican policeman?"</p>

<p>"Because the mountebank was an American. He
may even have been a soldier and have hidden himself
among your men."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was an American, was he?" laughed Donald.
"Then I believe we can put our finger on him
with ease. But the man we have in mind always
carried with him an ape."</p>

<p>"Then it may not be the same," replied Don Esteban,
"for this one had no ape with him either
time."</p>

<p>"It certainly does look like a mystery," was Adrian's
comment. "Where is the vault from which
the box was taken?"</p>

<p>"On the other side of the patio."</p>

<p>"May we examine it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'll show it to you now."</p>

<p>Don Esteban led the way downstairs and across
the patio. Opening the rear door of the bank, he
escorted them within and closed the door.</p>

<p>Passing behind the counter, he opened the iron
door of the vault, disclosing within a good-sized
chamber, in the rear of which was set the great
steel safe, locked with a time lock.</p>

<p>"There," explained Don Esteban, pointing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" href="#Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
an upper shelf, "is where the box stood."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was not a large box, then!" said Adrian.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Not more than eight or nine inches
cube."</p>

<p>The boy examined the vault carefully by the
light of a gas jet.</p>

<p>"There seems no way that any one could have
entered except by the door," said Donald.</p>

<p>"None whatever!"</p>

<p>"You are sure there is no opening in the ceiling?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>Don Esteban led the boys out and locked the
door of the vault.</p>

<p>"Well," declared Donald as they came out into
the patio after finishing their inspection, not only
of the vault but of the rest of the office, "I guess
we had better go home and study over the matter
a little. I should not be surprised if we could
put our hands upon the mountebank with very little
trouble; but I feel sure he had nothing to do with
the disappearance of the box."</p>

<p>"I wish I could feel that way," said Adrian
after they were out of hearing of Don Esteban. "I
have never quite trusted Strong. There is something
strange about him."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a bit queer; but how on earth could
he have stolen the box if he did not even go behind
the counter?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't; but still I mistrust him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" href="#Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder where Ambrosio was all this time?"
mused Billie.</p>

<p>"Tied up at home, most likely. An American
among Americans would hardly feel like traveling
around with a hand organ and a monkey," was
Don's emphatic reply.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Santiago's residence they were
told that Strong had been there earlier in the
evening and seemed much disappointed at not finding
them at home.</p>

<p>"Did he leave any word?" asked Billie of the
portero.</p>

<p>"None, se&ntilde;or; but Donna Lucia would like to see
you in the library."</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Is Santiago worse?"</p>

<p>"No, se&ntilde;or. He is sleeping quietly. I could not
say what she wants, but she seemed considerably
disturbed."</p>

<p>"Better go up alone, Billie," said Donald. "If
we are needed, you can call us. We'll wait here
in the patio for a few minutes before we turn in."</p>

<p>Billie ran up the stairs and tapped at the library
door. He was immediately admitted by Lucia and
the door was closed behind him.</p>

<p>"It is getting to be a good deal of a family affair,"
laughed Adrian.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Donald, with a grin. "I wonder
where Josie and Mr. Black are?"</p>

<p>Adrian colored.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should have thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" href="#Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
them!"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Donald nonchalantly, "speaking of
family affairs naturally reminded me that you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Don!" came Billie's voice, breaking in upon
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Come up here, the both of you! Quick!"</p>

<p>The boys ran up the stairs two steps at a time.</p>

<p>"In here," and Billie held the library door open.
"I've something I want to show you."</p>

<p>He led the way to the table, and there, under
the glow of the lamp, stood a brass-bound box
about eight or nine inches cube.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>DONALD IS KIDNAPED.</h3>


<p>"Great Scott!" was the spontaneous exclamation
of both the newcomers. "Where did it come
from?"</p>

<p>"You tell," replied Billie. "Lucia says it was
not here an hour ago. Neither has any one been
in the room so far as she knows."</p>

<p>"Has she been here all the time?" asked Adrian.</p>

<p>"No, she was with Josie in her room for a time;
but the door into the patio was locked."</p>

<p>"Some one might have come in through the window."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" href="#Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"A fat chance, isn't there!" laughed Billie, pointing
to the only window in the room which was protected
with long and heavy iron bars, set so closely
together that a child would have had trouble in
squeezing through&mdash;much less a man.</p>

<p>"Does look a little difficult," replied Adrian.</p>

<p>"Worse than difficult. Impossible," was Donald's
comment.</p>

<p>"Did you hear any noise?" asked Billie of Lucia.</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"And you have never seen the box before?"</p>

<p>Lucia wrinkled her brows and thought deeply.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she finally said, "I have a sort
of a dim recollection that, away back in my childhood
somewhere, I have seen it or one just like
it."</p>

<p>"Away back in your childhood," laughed Donald,
"couldn't have been so very far, Se&ntilde;orita."</p>

<p>Lucia made a little grimace.</p>

<p>"I'm nearly seventeen," she said.</p>

<p>"Botheration!" said Billie. "We are not here to
discuss ages, but to find out how this box came here.
I have no doubt that Lucia has seen many similar
boxes in her time."</p>

<p>"Well," asked Donald, somewhat nettled, "what
do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, I want to search the house."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," declared Adrian. "Donna<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" href="#Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Lucia, will you lead the way?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Right this way; but don't go into
father's room. I know there is no one in there.
One of the servants has been with him every minute
of the time."</p>

<p>Headed by Lucia, the boys explored the house
from top to bottom, but not a sign of any one
could they find. So far as they could determine,
the box must have come in of its own self.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing we can and must do,"
said Billie, after they had returned to the library.
"We must keep a watch in this room to-night.
Whoever put the box here may return."</p>

<p>"Right!" from Don. "You do have occasional
lucid intervals, Billie."</p>

<p>Billie grinned, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"I think we may all stay here for a few hours,"
suggested Lucia. "Father is so much better that
I think we may have a little music. I will play
some accompaniments on the guitar and Josie can
sing."</p>

<p>"That will seem a good deal like being back in
the States," declared Adrian. "With the Stars and
Stripes flying over my head, a brigade of American
troops on guard and an American girl singing,
I can almost forget I am on Mexican soil."</p>

<p>"How about the accompanist?" queried Billie.</p>

<p>"Oh!" laughed Adrian, "we're quite willing to
adopt her. Hey, Donald?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Ad. Ask Billie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" href="#Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure we could do no better," was Billie's
gallant reply.</p>

<p>Lucia's suggestion was carried out and for a
couple of hours there was a merry little party under
Santiago's hospitable roof. Even the mysterious
box was forgotten and the young people were
giving themselves up to a jolly good time, when suddenly
there came a scream which caused every one
to turn their eyes toward the room in which the
sick man was supposed to be lying.</p>

<p>But there in the doorway he stood, his long night
robe reaching nearly to the floor and his thin black
hair standing almost on end.</p>

<p>"Father!" cried Lucia, rushing toward him
"What is it?"</p>

<p>He waved her off, but made no reply, while with
his long bony finger he pointed at the brass-bound
box.</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?" he asked in a shrill,
querulous tone. "Who brought back my secret
casket?"</p>

<p>"Yours?" came from every one in the room.</p>

<p>"Yes! Mine! Mine!!" he almost screamed.</p>

<p>"He's raving!" cried Josie. "Can't some one do
something for him?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied, and his voice became more
calm, "I am not raving. I know whereof I speak.
Quick! Let me look within it to see that all is
safe."</p>

<p>"It is locked, Father," said Lucia, coming to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" href="#Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
side, "and we have no key."</p>

<p>"I can unlock it," he cried. "I can unlock it.
Give it to me. Give it to me."</p>

<p>He staggered forward and seized the box in
his hands. For several seconds he fumbled with
it, turning it first upon one side and then upon another,
and at last raised the lid. He thrust in his
hand and then stopped as one stupefied.</p>

<p>"Empty! Empty!" he gasped in an almost audible
whisper. "The plan of Montezuma's mine is
gone! Gone!!"</p>

<p>A moment he stood and gazed around upon the
faces of those in the room and then collapsed upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Quickly the boys picked him up and carried him
to his bed and the attending physician was summoned.</p>

<p>Billie picked up the box and examined it curiously.</p>

<p>"I wonder how he opened it?" he mused. "There
must be some sort of a spring somewhere."</p>

<p>He felt the box all over, but could find nothing.
Then he closed it and set it upon the table. A
moment later Donald picked it up and tried to open
it, but it was locked fast.</p>

<p>"Nothing but mysteries," he said. "I'm getting
tired of them. But before anything else happens,
I'm going around and notify Don Esteban that the
box is here."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Adrian.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" href="#Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you'd better stay here. I'll take a mozo
with me."</p>

<p>He ran hastily down the stairs and a minute later
the boys heard the gate close behind him.</p>

<p>"I guess this is the quickest way," thought Donald
as he gained the sidewalk. "I'll not bother with
a mozo. With American soldiers on guard and my
automatic in my pocket, I have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later he was ringing the bell
at Don Esteban's house. He was hastily admitted
and at once conducted to that gentleman's presence,
where he narrated hastily what had occurred
at the other house.</p>

<p>"Who is this old man?" Don Esteban asked of
Donald.</p>

<p>Donald explained as best he could.</p>

<p>"Which is mighty little," he declared when he
had finished. "He is the greatest mystery we have
ever encountered. There is no doubt that he is
an Indian, but he speaks English like an Englishman."</p>

<p>"I must go and see him at once," declared Don
Esteban, rising.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can, sir, to-night. I don't
think the physician would permit it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the first thing in the morning. I
thank you, young sir. Won't you have a glass of
wine before you go?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not," replied Donald. "I've never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" href="#Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
acquired that Mexican habit yet. Good night, sir."</p>

<p>He left the house feeling greatly relieved that he
had reported the finding of the box and walked
slowly along whistling merrily. As he turned off
the street upon which Don Esteban lived he heard
soft footsteps behind him and turned hastily.</p>

<p>But he was too late.</p>

<p>Before he could see who it was, or ere he could
cry out, a cloak was thrown over his head and he
was picked up and carried away bodily.</p>

<p>Donald was not the boy to give in without a
struggle, but kick and squirm as he might, he could
not free himself. Presently those who were carrying
him stopped and laid him on the sidewalk. Then
he heard a knock and a gate opened. Then he
was lifted up again and, almost before he knew it,
he was thrust into a little room&mdash;a closet it seemed&mdash;and
the door closed upon him.</p>

<p>It was a hot night and the little place was stifling.</p>

<p>"I'll smother if I don't get out of this," he muttered.</p>

<p>Slowly he unwrapped the cloak from about his
head and at last freed himself completely from its
folds; but he secured little relief from the heat.</p>

<p>The room could not have been more than six feet
square and it did not take Donald long to run his
hand clear around the wall.</p>

<p>There was only one door, that through which he
had been thrust, and it was locked. He pounded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" href="#Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
upon it, but to no avail. Then he sat down to
think.</p>

<p>"There is certainly no use to sweat myself to
death," he told himself. "I'd better be as quiet
as I can. There is air enough coming under the
door so I won't suffocate, so I might just as well
wait and see what will turn up."</p>

<p>He ran his hand all over his automatic and found
it in good shape. Then he leaned back against the
wall opposite the door and waited. Ten minutes
later the door was suddenly yanked open, another
figure was bundled into the closet and the door
slammed shut, almost before Donald could think.</p>

<h3>A PLOT AGAINST FUNSTON.</h3>


<p>A muttered imprecation was the only intimation
that the figure which had been so unceremoniously
bundled into the closet was alive.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Donald in Spanish.</p>

<p>"Let me out of this," was the unsatisfactory response
in English.</p>

<p>"Oh!" from Donald. "You are an American.
Well, keep still and I'll help you to get rid of the
blanket."</p>

<p>He grabbed hold of the covering and the newcomer
was soon uncovered.</p>

<p>"Now, then, who are you?" asked Donald again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" href="#Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll show you who I am if I get hold of you,"
was the uncivil answer, and an arm shot out.</p>

<p>"Now look here," said Donald, "if you don't stop
that I'll let daylight through you. We are in a
bad box and the only thing to do is to make the
best of it."</p>

<p>"We?" exclaimed the newcomer. "Why do you
say we?"</p>

<p>"Because I am a prisoner the same as you are.
Now, who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm Lieutenant Grimes of the general's staff.
Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am Donald Mackay, on a special mission for
Gen. Funston."</p>

<p>"How did they get you?"</p>

<p>"Kidnaped me on the street. How did they get
you?"</p>

<p>"Same way. I had just left the general's quarters."</p>

<p>"I can see that some one might want to capture
you, lieutenant, but I cannot see what they want
of me."</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"About half an hour. By the way, are you
armed?"</p>

<p>"No; they took away my weapons. How about
you?"</p>

<p>"I have my automatic. I'd have used it when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" href="#Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
you came in, only you were dumped in so suddenly."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose the game is?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but we'll find out. I've been in
tighter places than this&mdash;but no hotter," after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Have you tried to get out?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but it was too hot work. The door seemed
pretty strong."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the two of us might force it," suggested
Grimes. "I'm a pretty husky chap."</p>

<p>"We might try," replied Donald. "The place is
so narrow we can get a good brace."</p>

<p>They put their feet against the opposite wall
and pushed against the door.</p>

<p>"We'll never make it that way," said the lieutenant.
"We'll have to throw ourselves at it."</p>

<p>"Not much room for that, Lieutenant, but you
give the word and we'll have a try."</p>

<p>Getting their bearings as well as they could in
the dark, they drew themselves back and then literally
threw themselves at the door. It gave way
with a snap and both fell to their feet on the outside.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash they were on their feet, Donald
with his weapon ready for instant action.</p>

<p>But there was no one in sight.</p>

<p>"That's mighty funny!" exclaimed the lieutenant.
"Lock two strong men up in a place like that and
not guard it."</p>

<p>"It's a mighty good thing for us they didn't,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" href="#Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
laughed Donald. "I wonder where we are?"</p>

<p>He glanced about the room which was dimly
lighted by a couple of lamps, fastened to the wall
by brackets. It was well&mdash;yes, elegantly furnished.
At one side of the room was the closet out of which
they had just emerged, while at the opposite side
were three doors. On a third side were two windows
and the fourth side was a plain wall.</p>

<p>"Not a bad-looking place," observed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Not at all," echoed Donald, "and there seem
plenty of means of exit."</p>

<p>"Sure, my boy; and if it's all the same to you,
we'll go. The sooner I get back the quicker I'll
be able to start something in this direction. Come
on!"</p>

<p>They crossed over to the doors and tried the first
one. It was locked. They tried the second and
it opened into another closet.</p>

<p>"Three times and out," laughed Donald as he
took hold of the knob of the last door.</p>

<p>It yielded to his touch and he opened it gently.
Then he quickly and quietly closed it.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Donald put his fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>"How many?" queried Lieut. Grimes.</p>

<p>"Three," was the whispered response. "Let's
hear what they have to say."</p>

<p>He opened the door a crack, through which they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" href="#Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
could see three men seated at a table. One wore
the uniform of a Mexican officer, the other was
dressed in Mexican costume, while the third was
unquestionably an American, although they could
only see his back.</p>

<p>"I have carried out my part of the agreement,"
the American was saying, "and now I want my
money."</p>

<p>"How do we know you have?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Haven't I put Gen. Funston into your hands?"</p>

<p>"We are not sure it is Funston," said the other.</p>

<p>"Then bring him out and look at him. You
know the general when you see him, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I think so, although I've never seen him but
once."</p>

<p>"Well, that is he, all right," declared the American.</p>

<p>Donald turned and looked at his companion.
Then he chuckled.</p>

<p>The lieutenant said nothing, but stroked his whiskers
which he wore in exact imitation of his chief.</p>

<p>"Lucky for the general," he whispered, and Donald
nodded his head that he understood.</p>

<p>The two Mexicans exchanged a few words under
their breath which Donald could not hear and
then the officer took from his breast pocket a large
wallet, from which he counted out ten bank notes.
They were yellow backs and Donald was not at
all surprised when the officer said:</p>

<p>"Here are ten one-thousand-dollar bills in American
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" href="#Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
money. We believe you are telling us the
truth, as your words are corroborated by the men
who brought him here. But if you are playing
us false, we shall know how to reach you."</p>

<p>The American shrugged his shoulders as he took
the bills, rolled them up nonchalantly and placed
them in his trousers pocket.</p>

<p>"You can find me at the Hidalgo Hotel whenever
you want me," he said, "and now I must be
going."</p>

<p>He arose from his seat, and as he did so, Donald
caught sight of his face. It was the mountebank,
Strong, but in his stylish clothing Don had
failed to recognize him.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" he muttered to himself, "the plot
thickens!"</p>

<p>"What's that?" queried the lieutenant, who
caught the muttered exclamation.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," replied Donald as the three men
walked toward a door in the farther end of the
room and he was enabled to speak without being
heard, "only that is the man I'm looking for. Let's
get out of the window and see if we can't head
him off."</p>

<p>He closed the door and turned the key which he
had quietly taken from the other side.</p>

<p>The windows were open and they looked out.
They were on the side of the house overlooking a
good-sized lawn.</p>

<p>"That's the reason they are not barred," explained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" href="#Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Donald. "Had they been front windows,
we might as well have been in jail. You go first
and I'll cover the retreat."</p>

<p>Lieut. Grimes sprang into the window and lowered
himself to the ground, just as a hand turned
the knob.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" muttered Donald. "Sorry I can't
wait to receive you," and he followed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>On the ground they could hear the men trying
to open the door and as they sped across the lawn
toward a high brick wall, the door gave way with
a crash and they could hear surprised voices.</p>

<p>"They have discovered our wreckage!" cried
Donald. "Over the wall you go!"</p>

<p>"You first this time," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"No, you first. I can boost you up, but I couldn't
pull you. You can pull me."</p>

<p>The argument was good and the lieutenant acted
upon it.</p>

<p>A minute later he was on top of the wall.</p>

<p>"Great C&aelig;sar!" he exclaimed. "There's nothing
under me but water."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," was the response. "Haul me
up."</p>

<p>The lieutenant leaned down and gave the lad a
hand.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said a minute later. "We
can't jump in, for there is no knowing where we
are."</p>

<p>"Sure," from Donald. "Let's run along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" href="#Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
wall."</p>

<p>This they did for about a hundred yards and
then the wall ended abruptly against what appeared
to be an abutment.</p>

<p>"We must act quickly," declared Donald. "They
think you are Funston and won't hurt you. Keep
up the deception. I'm going to swim for it. I'll
have help here just as quick as I can. So long,"
and, throwing off his coat, he jumped into the
water some twenty feet below.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>THE ADMIRAL TO THE RESCUE.</h3>


<p>When Donald struck the water he allowed himself
to go clear to the bottom, as he wanted to find
out just about how deep it was.</p>

<p>It was, as he had expected, about the depth of
the water in the harbor and he made up his mind
that he could not be far from some of the wharves
that constitute the water front.</p>

<p>When he came to the surface, he struck out away
from the wall, and by the light of the moon was
soon able to see the vessels in the offing. He could
also see that he was well north of the principal
docks.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll land at the first place that offers,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" href="#Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
he thought, "and find my way to headquarters from
there."</p>

<p>He struck out lustily, but had not been swimming
more than a couple of minutes, when he heard the
sharp exhaust of a gasoline launch.</p>

<p>Realizing that it must be an American craft, he
shouted at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>At first there was no response, but as the boat
came nearer and he shouted even more loudly, a
friendly hail came over the waters.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" came the voice as the boat
came to a stop.</p>

<p>"Here, to your port side," he replied.</p>

<p>The launch was started again slowly and Donald
was soon able to make himself visible.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" was the first question pumped
at him by the officer in command.</p>

<p>"Special messenger for Gen. Funston," was the
response.</p>

<p>"Where is your uniform?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a soldier. I am a civilian."</p>

<p>"A likely story," snapped the officer, who chanced
to be an ensign.</p>

<p>"I can't help how likely it is," snapped Donald
in return. "It's true, and I want to be put ashore
as quickly as possible. I have an important message
and the safety of one of his staff is involved.
There is also a plot on foot to capture the general
himself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! And besides, I can't put you ashore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" href="#Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
I am carrying a message to Admiral Fletcher."</p>

<p>"But my business is important," insisted Donald.</p>

<p>"So is mine," declared the ensign.</p>

<p>He ordered his launch full speed ahead in the
direction of the flagship.</p>

<p>"It's pretty tough," commented Donald, "but I'll
prove I am right when I get to the ship."</p>

<p>"I hope so," was the reply. "I haven't anything
against you and you may be telling the truth, but
I can't take any chances."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they drew up beside the
flagship.</p>

<p>"Up you go," said the ensign, motioning Donald
up the ladder. "I'll present you to the officer of
the deck," which he quickly did.</p>

<p>"Here's a man I picked up in the water, sir, who
says he has a message for Gen. Funston, but I
had no time to put him ashore."</p>

<p>"Looks more like a boy than a man," replied the
officer. Then to Donald: "What's this about you
having a message for Gen. Funston?"</p>

<p>Donald repeated what he had told the ensign.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked another officer, coming forward
out of the shadow of the after turret.</p>

<p>The first officer saluted.</p>

<p>"Tell the Admiral your story, my lad," he said.</p>

<p>Again Donald repeated his story, this time going
more into detail.</p>

<p>"Come with me," ordered the Admiral, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" href="#Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
led the way to the wireless operator.</p>

<p>"Get into communication with Gen. Funston at
once," was the admiral's order.</p>

<p>"Here he is, sir," was the report a couple of
minutes later.</p>

<p>"Ask him if he has three American boys on a
special mission."</p>

<p>The answer came back promptly that he had.</p>

<p>"Ask him if Lieut. Grimes is missing."</p>

<p>Again came back the answer that he was.</p>

<p>"Tell the general that we have one of the lads
on the <i>Arkansas</i>, and that he has had a strange adventure.
Tell him I will send the lad ashore immediately."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Donald. "I knew some
one would know what to do."</p>

<p>"You're a brave lad," was the Admiral's comment,
"and I shall be glad to hear the end of the
adventure. You and your companions must come
out and dine with us as soon as your mission is
ended."</p>

<p>Donald thanked him for his kindness and hastened
to the launch which was to take him back.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later he stood before Gen.
Funston.</p>

<p>"You seem to have been in the water," was the
general's first words.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," laughed Donald. "I jumped from a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" href="#Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
wall north of town, leaving Lieut. Grimes on top
of it."</p>

<p>"What! Lieut. Grimes on top of a wall? How
did he get there?"</p>

<p>"He was kidnapped, sir! It was a case of mistaken
identity!"</p>

<p>"Mistaken identity! I don't understand!"</p>

<p>"They took him for you, sir, because his beard
is trimmed like yours."</p>

<p>The general smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Think I shall have all my staff officers do the
same," he commented. Then more seriously: "Can
you lead us to the house?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure about the house; but I can take
you to the stone wall from which I jumped. That
ought to guide us to the house."</p>

<p>"Right," said the general.</p>

<p>He called another member of his staff and gave
a few brief orders.</p>

<p>In another ten minutes two launches loaded with
regulars and armed with a rapid-fire gun in each,
steamed swiftly up the harbor.</p>

<p>"There's the wall!" exclaimed Donald a few minutes
later, "and there's where I jumped," pointing
to a spot near the abutment.</p>

<p>The officer in command headed the boats for
the shore.</p>

<p>"It is not only a question of freeing Lieut.
Grimes," said the officer, "but we also want to capture
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" href="#Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
the conspirators. This is a much more serious
matter than Gen. Funston is willing to admit."</p>

<p>"Then if you will take my suggestion, sir," said
Donald modestly, "I would let a few soldiers go
over the wall as well as entering the front of the
house."</p>

<p>The officer looked up twenty feet. The wall was
absolutely perpendicular and as smooth as the side
of a house.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid none of my men can scale it," he
said.</p>

<p>"Can't we throw a grapnel over it, sir?"</p>

<p>"We might; but it would be a very slight hold."</p>

<p>"If you can make it hold at all," laughed Donald,
"I'm willing to make the effort. At best I
can only fall back into the water."</p>

<p>"True," declared the officer. "We'll try it."</p>

<p>A grapnel was tied to a long line, such as is used
in tying the launch to the shore, and after several
vain attempts the grapnel caught in the top of
the wall.</p>

<p>Donald sprang forward and tested it with his
weight and it held. Then, without another word,
he braced his feet against the wall and in almost
less time than it takes to write it, he was at the
top.</p>

<p>"Do you see any one?" asked the officer from
below.</p>

<p>"No, sir; but there is the sound of pacing footsteps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" href="#Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
on the walk that runs along the side of the
house."</p>

<p>"Good! Now make fast the grapnel and we will
see if there are a dozen men here who can climb to
the top."</p>

<p>The dozen were quickly found and they were soon
at the top of the wall. The officer finally decided
to add to their armament one of the rapid-firers.</p>

<p>"If there is any resistance," he said, "we'll knock
the side of the house in."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"You'd better come back into the boat. You
can help us to enter the house in front."</p>

<p>Donald slid down the rope and the expedition
quickly made a landing. Silently, so as not to
alarm those within the house, the men took their
way to the front of the mansion, which was at once
recognized as one of the finest in Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>"Do you know who lives here?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Donald.</p>

<p>"I was told it was the residence of one of Huerta's
generals," said a soldier. "It was pointed out
to me the first day we landed."</p>

<p>"Good!" from the officer. "I shall now have
no compunction about entering the place."</p>

<p>With Donald and a couple of soldiers, the officer
approached the door and gave a vigorous knock.</p>

<p>There was no response and he knocked again.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" finally came a voice, evidently
a mozo.</p>

<p>"An American officer. Open the door in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" href="#Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
name of the law."</p>

<p>There was a still further delay and then another
voice asked: "How do we know it is an officer?"</p>

<p>"Open and find out, before I force the door."</p>

<p>There was a still further delay.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing we guarded the rear," said
Donald. "They are evidently trying to gain time
to spirit Lieut. Grimes away, thinking it is Gen.
Funston."</p>

<p>"True," said the officer. "We'll wait no longer.
Corporal, force the door!"</p>

<p>The corporal placed a small stick of dynamite
under the door and fixed a fuse.</p>

<p>"Step back a little," he said.</p>

<p>All obeyed, when at the instant the door was
thrown open and a hand, in which was an automatic
revolver, was thrust out, directly in the face
of the officer.</p>

<p>But quick as was the action, Donald was not
taken off his guard.</p>

<p>With a single swift blow he struck the weapon
into the air.</p>

<p>At the same instant a fusillade from the rear
of the house gave evidence that the men stationed
upon the wall had done their work.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>BILLIE MAKES A DISCOVERY.</h3>


<p>Having released Lieut. Grimes and taken the
plotters into custody, the next task was to locate
Strong, the mountebank, and to solve the mystery
of the box.</p>

<p>Outside the one exclamation which Donald had
uttered when he recognized Strong as the third of
the plotters, he had not betrayed his secret to any
one, and when Lieut. Grimes told his story to Gen.
Funston and described the American, Donald
vouchsafed no information which might help to
apprehend him.</p>

<p>"The plotter told the Mexicans that he could be
found at the Hidalgo Hotel whenever he was
wanted," explained Lieut. Grimes. "While he may
have lied about it, I think we should send a force
and try to locate him."</p>

<p>The advice was acted upon and a corporal and
four soldiers sent to the hotel, but to no purpose.
No such man was known there.</p>

<p>"What was the use of my saying anything about
it?" asked Donald of the other two boys when
he returned to Santiago's house and narrated to
them the story of his evening's adventure. "I was
sure he was not there and I have no idea where he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" href="#Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
is; but we'll find him and the ten thousand dollars
given him by the Mexicans for his treachery."</p>

<p>"That's right, Don," was Billie's comment. "If
you can get that money and I can get my ten thousand
pounds, this trip won't be so bad."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," said Adrian, "I propose that
some of us go to bed. It's nearly two o'clock and
there is mighty little chance that any one will try
to steal the box again."</p>

<p>"I think you are right," said Billie. "We might
as well all go. The doctor is still with Santiago and
will stay until he is better. It isn't at all likely
that any one will try to come into this room while
he is here."</p>

<p>Billie voiced the unanimous opinion, and a few
minutes later the young people had all sought their
beds, leaving instructions with the physician and
the servants that they were to be called if any change
for the worse occurred in Santiago's condition.</p>

<p>It was probably two hours later, just about daylight,
that the entire household was awakened by
a terrible shriek and one of the maids rushed out
into the patio.</p>

<p>The boys came to their feet with a bound and
hurried from their room on the ground floor, while
the others appeared at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Donald as soon as he could
quiet the shrieking maid. "What are you yelling
about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, se&ntilde;or!" she cried. "I have seen the devil."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," laughed the boy. "You had a nightmare."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" href="#Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, se&ntilde;or. It was the devil. He had horns and
a tail and he had the little box under his arm. I
saw him!"</p>

<p>"The box!" cried Billie. "Quick, Lucia, look and
see if the box is gone!"</p>

<p>The girl rushed back into the library and she, too,
gave a shriek.</p>

<p>"It's gone!" she cried. "It's gone!"</p>

<p>The boys sprang up the stairs three at a time
and into the library. Lucia was right. The box
was gone.</p>

<p>"It must be the old boy, sure enough," said Billie,
"or at least one of his imps." Then to the maid:
"How did he get in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, se&ntilde;or. I only saw him go out.
He went right through the door without opening
it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" from Donald. "His Satanic majesty
might go through a solid door, but the box
wouldn't. There is some other explanation."</p>

<p>"But who could it be?" queried Lucia in great
fear.</p>

<p>"Some one who knows the house," declared
Adrian emphatically. "He may have put on some
masquerade costume just to frighten these superstitious
servants in case he was discovered."</p>

<p>"I believe Ad is right," agreed Donald. "What
do you think, Billie?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, Don; but I have a theory of my own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" href="#Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
If I am right, I can work it better if I tell no one."</p>

<p>At this moment the physician entered the room.</p>

<p>"How is Santiago?" asked Donald.</p>

<p>"Better! He has gone to sleep, and if he is not
disturbed, I expect him to be greatly improved when
he awakens. I should not be surprised if this
were the turning point in his illness."</p>

<p>"Then we had all better go down on to the first
floor and leave him alone with his nurses."</p>

<p>"I'd give a good deal to know where Strong is,"
remarked Donald as they were drinking their coffee
an hour later.</p>

<p>"So would I," declared Billie. "I believe, if we
can find him, we can solve this entire mystery."</p>

<p>"As soon as we finish our coffee," suggested Donald,
"let's get busy and find him. He can't be far."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Adrian. "We'll round him
up in short order. Hey, Billie?"</p>

<p>"We ought to; but I'll tell you what. You fellows
go out and see if you can get a line on him,
and I'll hang round the house to see that the devil
doesn't come and steal the rest of the house."</p>

<p>"Especially Lucia," laughed Donald.</p>

<p>"That's all right," was the good-natured reply;
"but I have an idea that the devil and Strong may
have something in common."</p>

<p>"You don't think it was Strong who came and
took the box, do you?" queried Adrian.</p>

<p>"I don't know just what I do think, Ad; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" href="#Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
I'm going to do a little detective work and I want
to give the impression that we are all out. When
you fellows go out, don't say anything that would
cause any one in hiding to think we are not all
going out together. Do you sabe?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I hope you'll get a clue if we do not."</p>

<p>When the others had gone, Billie sat quietly in
his room for a long time. He could easily have
gone to sleep, as he had had only a couple of hours'
rest, but he made up his mind that he would not
be caught napping again if anything should happen.</p>

<p>But nothing happened.</p>

<p>The minutes passed into hours and it was rapidly
nearing noon when Billie made up his mind that
it was a bad job.</p>

<p>"We had our chance at daylight," he muttered,
"and now we will not get another. Whoever is
after the box, has it and is not going to take any
further chance of being caught."</p>

<p>He went out into the patio and looked up at the
sun. It was almost in the zenith and the air was
stifling.</p>

<p>"Any one would be a fool to go out at this time
of day," he mused. "I wonder where the fellows
are?"</p>

<p>He stepped back under the shade of the arcade
that extended clear around the patio and threw
himself onto a stone seat.</p>

<p>"Queer old place," he thought, "and a queer old
seat."</p>

<p>He laid his hand on one of the carved arms and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" href="#Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
mechanically toyed with an eagle's head that formed
one of the decorations. To his surprise the head
turned in his hand.</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't broken it," he said as he examined
it more closely.</p>

<p>It was clearly made to revolve and so he turned
it clear around, when of a sudden the arm of the
seat fell apart and the bottom collapsed, disclosing
to Billie's astonished eyes a pair of stairs.</p>

<p>Almost thrown to the pavement by the giving
way of the seat, Billie picked himself up and looked
about to see if he were observed.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight and he stooped down
and examined the stairs carefully. Then he
straightened up and rubbed his chin as a sudden
gleam of intelligence passed through his brain.</p>

<p>"So," he muttered, "this is why Santiago dwells
in a house that is directly back of the banker's.
That was his box and he is the strange man who
made the million-dollar deposit in Don Esteban's
bank."</p>

<p>Then he stopped and pondered.</p>

<p>"But who stole the box? Not Santiago, for he
has not left his room for days. If it was Strong,
he must have entered the bank from some direction
other than this. I don't understand, but I'm going
to make some further investigation."</p>

<p>He re&euml;ntered his room, buckled on his automatic
and took from his suit case&mdash;which, by the way, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" href="#Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
had located at the railway station along with that
of his companions after the occupation of the city
by the marines&mdash;his electric torch. Then he went
out and descended the stairs, which he discovered
were twenty-four in number.</p>

<p>Reaching the bottom he found himself upon a
landing some six or eight feet square, from the
opposite side of which another flight of stairs
ascended.</p>

<p>"I reckon I better see where they lead to," was
his comment as he slowly began their ascent.</p>

<p>After going up eighteen stairs his head touched
the floor above. He counted the remaining steps
by the light of his torch and found that there were
six more. This would make the floor over his head
on an exact level with the floor of Santiago's
house.</p>

<p>"It's just as I expected," he muttered. "If I can
get through this floor, I shall find myself in Don
Esteban's residence&mdash;somewhere. But just where?
That's the question."</p>

<p>He pushed upon the stone above his head, but
it refused to move. Then he held up his torch
and examined the ceiling carefully. Whatever the
method by which the stones could be moved, it
was carefully concealed.</p>

<p>Much chagrined, Billie at length decided to retrace
his steps and await the coming of his companions.
He reached the landing and crossed over
to the steps by which he had descended.</p>

<p>Glancing up, he uttered an exclamation of surprise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" href="#Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
for there at the opening and peering down
the stairs was Ambrosio, the ape.</p>

<p>With a cry of recognition the simian started to
descend the stairs, but at a noise from above he
hesitated and then sprang back and out of sight.</p>

<p>An instant later the opening was closed and Billie
was left in the darkness, except for the light
of his torch.</p>

<h3>THE MYSTERY DEEPENS.</h3>


<p>While Billie was making his discoveries Donald
and Adrian had also been busy.</p>

<p>When they left the house, at Donald's suggestion,
they went first to the bank and told Don Esteban
about the disappearance of the box and what
the maid had seen. He was much disappointed until
it was explained to him that they also had another
clue.</p>

<p>"We shall spend our time in the slums," said Donald,
"while our chum keeps watch at the house. We
feel sure that between us we shall solve the mystery."</p>

<p>"I hope so," was Don Esteban's response. "Do
you think I might be able to see this man Santiago?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, sir! The doctor wants him to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" href="#Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
sleep as long as he can. We will let you know
later in the day."</p>

<p>Leaving Don Esteban, the boys started for the
plaza, intending to play the part of sightseers and
visit every place in which a mountebank might reasonably
expect to go. They felt certain that Strong
would keep away from the more aristocratic places.</p>

<p>Keeping their eyes open and ever on the alert,
they wandered about the streets and into many public
places, but up to eleven o'clock had made no
discovery. Then they entered a cantina for breakfast,
purposely choosing one that was little frequented
by Americans.</p>

<p>Seating themselves at a table in one corner where
they could see without being seen, the boys ordered
a hearty breakfast and then turned their
attention to the others in the place.</p>

<p>At the table nearest them were three men of
ordinary appearance, busy with their meal. Beyond
them was an American soldier, who seemed to have
dropped in out of curiosity. He was paying very
little attention to his meal, but was eyeing a young
woman who was seated behind the cash counter.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room, and partially hidden
from our boys by the cash counter, was another
man, smoking, and evidently waiting for
some one. He kept his eye on the door and every
once in a while glanced nervously at his watch.</p>

<p>"Not much going on in here," said Donald in
English.</p>

<p>"No; but we are a little early. There may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" href="#Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
more in before we finish our breakfast."</p>

<p>It was a true prediction, for within the next
five minutes as many more persons entered and disposed
themselves around the various tables. Then
the boys' breakfast was served and for a few minutes
they were more absorbed in the food than
in the guests.</p>

<p>As Donald raised his eyes for a moment, however,
he caught sight of a man talking to the one
sitting back of the cash counter. They were evidently
arguing about something in an undertone
and a minute later the newcomer took a seat with
his back to the boys.</p>

<p>"Look!" was Donald's smothered exclamation,
"over there by the cashier. Isn't that our man?"</p>

<p>Adrian raised his eyes and gazed hard at the
back of the man's head.</p>

<p>"I could tell better if he would remove his hat.
It does look like him, but he has disguised himself
some way."</p>

<p>"Sure," laughed Donald. "That's part of his
trade; but I'm dead sure it is Strong."</p>

<p>"What had we better do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He'll recognize us the minute he
sees us. If he is keeping away from us, he will
leave. If he is not, he may come over and speak
to us. There is no reason why he should not, so far
as he knows."</p>

<p>"How would it do to make ourselves visible?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know." Then after a pause: "I'll tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" href="#Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
you what. As soon as we finish we'll go out, as
though we did not see him, but we will be sure to
make enough commotion to attract his attention.
Then we'll station ourselves where we can see him
as he comes out."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Don; but suppose he doesn't
come out?"</p>

<p>Donald scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed, "I knew I had a thought
back of that. When he sees us, if he is not trying
to avoid us, he will speak to us. If he does not
speak to us, we will know there is something wrong
and take immediate steps to have him arrested."</p>

<p>"But he may escape."</p>

<p>"How can he?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he could go out through the kitchen
if he had to," was the ready reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose he could. We must do better
than that."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Adrian. "I'll go over and
speak to that soldier in English. If it is Strong, he
will hear me and will involuntarily make some move.
If he wants to make himself known, he will. If
he does not do so, we will simply sit here till he
goes out and then shadow him."</p>

<p>"That sounds good. Go over and say 'Howdy'
to the soldier."</p>

<p>Adrian arose from his seat and stepped over to
the soldier.</p>

<p>"Hello, partner!" was his somewhat noisy greeting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" href="#Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
"Won't you come over to our table?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure, neighbor! I was just thinking that
I was getting mighty lonesome."</p>

<p>He arose from his chair and took a seat beside
Donald, who had been observing Strong closely.
There could be no doubt that he had been attracted
by Adrian's voice, but he gave no intimation that
he knew the boys.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," said Donald, without taking
his eyes from his man. "Won't you have another
cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>"Bet your life, neighbor!" Then as he lighted
a fresh cigarette: "Smoke?"</p>

<p>"Never learned!" laughed Donald. "Seems
mighty funny down here, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure does; but you're just as well off without it.
Live here?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Adrian; "we were on our way
home and got stuck!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the soldier, with
much concern. "Out of coin?"</p>

<p>"We haven't much; but Gen. Funston has promised
to find us passage home in a few days. Our
friend saw him early this morning," this latter
remark expressly for Strong's ears.</p>

<p>"If he told you he'd do it, he will," said the soldier.
"You can bet on him every time."</p>

<p>It was very evident from Strong's actions that
he was taking in every word of the conversation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" href="#Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
which was in English and in an unusually loud
voice. He pretended to eat, then leaned over and
said something to his companion, and a minute
later arose from the table and hastily quitted the
place.</p>

<p>But the boys were not to be fooled. They sprang
from the table and hastily followed, Donald throwing
a greenback to the cashier which more than
doubly paid the bill.</p>

<p>Their sudden action did not escape the soldier,
who, attributing it to another cause, also hastily
quitted the cantina.</p>

<p>As the boys emerged into the street, they saw
Strong hastening away in the direction of the custom
house.</p>

<p>"Going to lose himself in the crowd," said Donald.
"Don't let him get out of your sight."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the soldier, running
to catch up with the boys. "Ugly greasers?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Donald, "we're shadowing a man
who is wanted by Gen. Funston. That's him,"
pointing; "keep your eye on him."</p>

<p>"I thought you chaps had something on," laughed
the soldier. "You can bet on me!"</p>

<p>Now that they approached nearer the center of
the business portion of the city, there were more
people on the street; but they were so near their
quarry that they easily kept him in sight. Only
once had he glanced back, but that was enough to
convince him that he was followed.</p>

<p>"He's headed for somewhere," said Adrian. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" href="#Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
doesn't expect to get away from us simply by walking."</p>

<p>"Right," agreed Donald. "There he goes into
the post office."</p>

<p>"Yes," from Adrian, "and it has two doors. You
stop at the first one and I'll run to the other."</p>

<p>He started on a run and the soldier followed
suit.</p>

<p>The sight of a man running and a soldier following,
quickly attracted attention and pedestrians
began to stop and see what the matter might be.
In less than a minute a crowd had collected, among
them several soldiers, who quickly brought Adrian
to a halt.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked one. Then as the
soldier came up: "What are you chasing him for?"</p>

<p>"I'm not chasing him," laughed the seeming pursuer.
"He and I are after another chap."</p>

<p>The delay occasioned by this interference was
not great, but it was sufficient to allow Strong
to escape, had it not been for Donald. He had
seen the crowd gathering and, realizing what would
happen, ran around the other way, just in time to
see Strong disappearing around the corner of the
street on which the bank was located.</p>

<p>Madly he dashed down the street and turned the
corner in time to see Strong enter the big gate
leading into the patio of Don Esteban's residence.</p>

<p>Putting on more steam, a couple of minutes later
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" href="#Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Donald also dashed into the patio; but Strong was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"He must be in the bank," muttered the boy, and
he quickly entered the door.</p>

<p>But Strong had disappeared as completely as
though the earth had opened and swallowed him
up.</p>

<h3>THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</h3>


<p>When the opening at the head of the stairs had
closed upon Billie and he realized that he was shut
in a subterranean passage, for a minute his heart
sank within him.</p>

<p>He had tried to find an opening at the top of
the opposite stairs and had failed, and he did not
know that he would have any better success in
trying to find a way to open the place through which
he had descended.</p>

<p>"Nobody on earth knows that I am down here,"
he thought, "and with Santiago sick and maybe
dying, no one on earth probably knows that there
is such a passage."</p>

<p>But Billie was not the lad to sit down and cry.
He had been in tight places before and he had
an abiding faith in his own ability to do things.
Therefore, he called up his courage and slowly
mounted the stairs leading to Santiago's patio.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs he found himself confronted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" href="#Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
by exactly the same condition as he had
found on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"But there is this difference," muttered Billie. "I
know that there must be some sort of a crack where
that slab fell back."</p>

<p>He held the electric bull's-eye close to the stone
and scrutinized every spot.</p>

<p>Not a single crack could he spy.</p>

<p>Then he took out his big jack-knife and prodded
with it clear across the width of the stairway.</p>

<p>There was nothing but solid stone.</p>

<p>"Looks kind o' desperate," he told himself, "but
I have simply got to find an opening."</p>

<p>Again he prodded the place over without result.</p>

<p>"It's no use," he finally said to himself. "If I
am to get out of here, help will have to come from
somewhere outside. But how can it?"</p>

<p>He sat down on the stairs and thought deeply.</p>

<p>"If it is as I think," he mused, "these stairs have
been used recently. The very fact that Ambrosio
is prowling around here is proof that Strong must
have been here at some time. But where is
Strong?"</p>

<p>He slid down several steps and threw the light
of his torch across to the opposite stairs.</p>

<p>"Bang!" went something that sounded like a
falling stone.</p>

<p>Billie sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Click! Bang!" and down the opposite stairway<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" href="#Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
streamed a ray of light.</p>

<p>Billie shut off his electric torch and waited.</p>

<p>Then on the steps there appeared a foot, then
another, until a whole human body was in sight.
Then "click, snap!" and the light disappeared.</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Billie under his breath,
"there's a man on the stairs right opposite to me.
Who on earth can it be?"</p>

<p>His first inclination was to turn on the light, but
on second thought he decided not to.</p>

<p>"I'll let him set the copy," thought Billie. "It's
a mighty good thing to be able to spring the surprise."</p>

<p>He drew his automatic and stood ready for any
emergency.</p>

<p>It was still as a tomb.</p>

<p>He could hear his own heart beat and he could
also hear the heavy breathing of the other man.</p>

<p>"Sounds like he had been running and was just
catching his breath," was Billie's mental comment.</p>

<p>After some minutes the man's breathing became
more quiet and Billie heard him slowly descending
the stairs.</p>

<p>"This won't do," thought Billie. "He probably
has some kind of a light, and if he gets on the landing
and I'm up here, I'll be like a man up a tree."</p>

<p>The lad sat down and slowly slid toward the
bottom.</p>

<p>Being only a few steps from the landing, Billie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" href="#Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
was down first. He crowded to the right and
listened.</p>

<p>The other was now nearly on the landing. Now
he was on the landing, hugging the wall on the
side opposite Billie. Now they passed each other,
or rather the man passed Billie, for Billie stood
perfectly still.</p>

<p>It seemed as though he must hear Billie's breathing,
but if he heard anything he must have thought
it his own echo, never dreaming that he was not
alone in the passage.</p>

<p>Now Billie could hear him ascending the stairs
leading to Santiago's house, and his hope rose
high.</p>

<p>"He must know how to open the floor," thought
Billie. "I'll be right there when he does."</p>

<p>Silently as a cat Billie crept up the stairs behind
his unknown companion.</p>

<p>Near the top the man stopped and a minute later
he flashed an electric light against the stone overhead.
Another minute and he heaved with the top
of his head and the slab slid back.</p>

<p>"And now," exclaimed Billie in a deep voice, "put
your hands over your head!"</p>

<p>Whether from fear or from the unparalleled surprise
caused by hearing a human voice at such a
time and in such a place, instead of obeying Billie's
command, Strong's hands&mdash;for Strong it was&mdash;fell
limp at his side and his electric torch fell to
the stones beneath his feet.</p>

<p>"All right," continued Billy, "if that's the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" href="#Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
you feel about it; but just remember that a single
false move and I'll cut this automatic loose among
your ribs. Now climb out a step at a time."</p>

<p>With face as white as marble at the shock he
had just sustained, Strong obeyed implicitly and
Billie was soon standing on the stone patio, looking
Strong in the face.</p>

<p>"You're a good one, you are," he said sarcastically.
"I should think you'd be ashamed to call
yourself an American."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Strong in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>"Why, first of all, stealing from the bank, and
then selling your own countrymen to the Mexicans."</p>

<p>"Who have I sold?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you didn't sell Gen.
Funston to the greasers for ten thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" in a somewhat stronger voice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll deny that you are Strong, the
mountebank. You don't think for one minute that
I don't know you in spite of your make-up, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll admit that I'm the mountebank. As for
my name that is of small importance in a country
like this. But I did not sell Gen. Funston, as you
put it. I knew the man I pointed out was not Funston
and I knew that as soon as the Mexicans
found it out they would let him go. Some one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" href="#Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
might have told them rightly. As it was I spoiled
their game and I got the money. Do you think it
any crime to do that?"</p>

<p>"That's a matter I am not in a position to discuss,"
was Billie's answer. "But how about robbing
the bank?"</p>

<p>"I had as much right to the box as any one."</p>

<p>"You'll have to prove that to some one besides
me; all I can do is to turn you over to the authorities."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Strong. "I'll die before I'll rot
in a Mexican jail!"</p>

<p>He uttered a peculiar noise and before Billie
could imagine what it meant, he felt himself seized
from behind by a pair of hairy hands.</p>

<p>He had been in that clutch once before and
recognized in an instant that he was in the grip of
the ape.</p>

<p>He gave one loud cry for help and then turned
loose with his automatic.</p>

<p>The tumult which followed is beyond description.
Billie's shout was as nothing compared to
the cry of the ape as one of the bullets struck
him in the leg and another pierced his foot. Loosing
his hold upon the lad, he grabbed for the
weapon, but Billie managed to evade him and would
undoubtedly have slain the animal had not Strong
sprung to his assistance, with the result that in another
minute Billie was disarmed.</p>

<p>Ill would the lad have fared then, at the hands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" href="#Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of his two assailants, had not the noise attracted
to the scene several soldiers, while an instant later
came a loud shout as Donald and Adrian dashed
into the patio.</p>

<p>On the other side of the square they had heard
Billie's shout, followed by the automatic, and had
rushed to his aid.</p>

<p>In another minute both Strong and his hairy
friend were overcome and securely bound.</p>

<p>"Where did you find him?" asked Donald, pointing
to Strong.</p>

<p>"Down there," was Billie's reply, as he pointed
toward the still open underground passage way.</p>

<p>"How did he get there?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he entered from a similar entrance
in Don Esteban's patio. I have had an idea all
the time that there was some reason for the position
of these two houses."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't lead into the bank. How could
he steal the box out of the vault?"</p>

<p>"There is the real thief!" exclaimed Billie, pointing
to the ape. "He sneaked in while Strong kept
the bank employ&eacute;s engaged. By some mistake in
his understanding he put the envelope back in the
bank the next day instead of putting back the box.
It was he who crawled through the bars into Santiago's
library. He was also the devil who scared
the maid almost into fits."</p>

<p>"Well! Well!" exclaimed a voice from the
gateway. "I never could have believed it."</p>

<p>The voice was that of Don Esteban, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" href="#Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
entered while Billie was speaking.</p>

<p>"I have come to see this strange man, Santiago
Ojeda," he explained. "What says the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Here comes the doctor now," announced
Adrian as the physician made his appearance in
the gateway. "He can speak for himself."</p>

<h3>THE TREASURE OF MONTEZUMA.</h3>


<p>The shadows of evening had fallen and a cool
breeze was blowing in off the Gulf of Mexico when
a group of persons, among whom were the Broncho
Rider Boys, gathered around the bedside of the sick
man.</p>

<p>It was as the physician had predicted, and when
Santiago had awakened after his long sleep, he
had regained his senses, although he was very weak.
But as the day declined and the heat lessened he
had become stronger, and now at his own request,
Lucia and her friends drew around to listen to his
tale.</p>

<p>At one side of the bed stood Lucia, the three boys
and Don Esteban. At the other stood Mr. Black,
Josie and the physician, while at the foot of the
bed was Strong, with Ambrosio in his arms, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" href="#Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
couple of soldiers who had the mountebank in
custody.</p>

<p>"As my daughter knows," began Santiago in a
feeble voice, "I am a direct descendant of the great
Montezuma. My ancestor was the guardian of
the treasure which had been accumulated by the
Aztec kings for years. After the overthrow of my
race by the Spanish conquerors, there was given to
my first great ancestor the keeping of the secret
of the source of the gold which had made the city
of Anahuac such a rich prize.</p>

<p>"This secret has been handed down through all
these generations, the one object being to use this
knowledge in freeing Mexico from the Spanish
yoke. This secret I, as the last of my race,
possess."</p>

<p>The aged man paused, his strength being hardly
able to the task he had set himself.</p>

<p>"It is much as I suspected," whispered Don
Esteban to Donald, while Lucia bent over and
smoothed the brow of the sick man.</p>

<p>"A few years ago," Santiago finally continued,
"I began to see an opportunity for the people to
assert their rights. In our good Se&ntilde;or Madero I
saw the one who should lead the common people out
of their bondage. I went to him and offered him
all the wealth at my command. He accepted the
trust and we began our work. It was at that time
that I placed the money with Don Esteban. Also
the box, containing the secret of the mine, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" href="#Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
which only I and Madero knew.</p>

<p>"You all know what has happened since that
time. Madero won, but he was betrayed. His betrayer
now seeks to rule the republic, but he can
never do it. He must be overthrown."</p>

<p>The aged man became greatly excited and the
physician cautioned him to be careful. In a few
minutes he became more peaceful and continued:</p>

<p>"I have always been a great friend of the Americans.
I admired their integrity and their government.
I spent many years of my youth in the
United States. I have known many of their great
men. I was sure they would be pleased with Madero,
and they were. But after he was betrayed,
then I began to fear them, as I was told that the
usurper, Huerta, had been helped by them."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" asked Billie, almost without
thinking.</p>

<p>"That man there," and Santiago pointed with his
long bony finger at the mountebank, Strong.
"That man, Francisco Rodriguez, who claims to
be an American, but who is a traitor to his country.
He fed me with lies, as I now know, and he
wormed out of me the secret of Montezuma's
Mine."</p>

<p>Again the aged man's excitement nearly overcame
him, but again he rallied with an almost superhuman
effort.</p>

<p>"It was because of his lies that I made him my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" href="#Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
trusted agent; but he betrayed me as he has others.
It was to him I gave the ten thousand pounds which
the young se&ntilde;or took away from my servant, Pablo
Ojeda&mdash;who is not an Ojeda, but whom I have
allowed to use that name. I desire that the money
become the property of the young se&ntilde;or," and he
feebly extended his hand toward Billie, "who has
always been such a good friend to me and mine.
The secret of the mine is to be found in the box
which I left with Don Esteban. I am getting to be
an old man, and if you will now bring in the box,
I will turn it over to my daughter Lucia, who is
my only descendant."</p>

<p>Don Esteban made no move to comply with the
request, but looked at the boys in such a perplexed
manner that the sick man was quick to take notice.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, rising on his elbow and
looking at Don Esteban with burning gaze. "What
is it? Has anything happened to the box?"</p>

<p>"Yes," faltered the banker, "it has been stolen."</p>

<p>"Stolen!" almost shrieked Santiago. "Stolen!
Then there stands the thief!" and he pointed to
Strong, who stood with blanched face.</p>

<p>"We know that," said Billie, "but the box has
been stolen again and no one knows where it has
gone."</p>

<p>"You are wrong," muttered Strong. "It has not
been stolen. It is in the bank where it always was."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried Don Esteban. "How could
it be back in the vault?"</p>

<p>"Ask Ambrosio," replied Strong, with a wan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" href="#Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
smile. "He can tell."</p>

<p>"Of course he cannot tell," almost shouted Don
Esteban.</p>

<p>"Then we shall never know; but I am sure the
box is there."</p>

<p>"Send for it! Send for it!" cried Santiago.
"Send for it at once that I may turn over to my
daughter the secret of the mine."</p>

<p>"That you will never be able to do," said Strong.
"It has been destroyed."</p>

<p>"Destroyed!" burst from almost every lip. "Destroyed?
How?"</p>

<p>Strong shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't tell. Again you'll have to ask Ambrosio.
It is he who destroyed it."</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Billie, "I knew I ought
to have killed that monk the first time I had any dealings
with him. I'm sorry now that I didn't."</p>

<p>"At any rate," declared Don Esteban, "I shall
send for the box."</p>

<p>He turned to Santiago, who had fallen back upon
his pillow, and over whom the physician was bending
and feeling his pulse.</p>

<p>"I shall send for it at once," he repeated.</p>

<p>Slowly the physician raised his head and loosed
his hold upon the sick man's wrist.</p>

<p>"It is too late," he said. "He will not need it.
He is dead."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On board a returning army transport bound for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" href="#Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
New York stood the Broncho Rider Boys casting
their last glance shoreward as the sun was setting
behind the mountains that form the background
of the city of Vera Cruz. Over the city still waved
the Stars and Stripes, and as the darkness fell and
the tip of Mt. Orizaba gradually faded from sight,
Billie turned to the others and in a voice tinged with
sadness remarked:</p>

<p>"There's only one thing about the whole country
that I admire."</p>

<p>"What's, that?" asked Adrian. "Lucia?"</p>

<p>"No; it's the wholesome respect the Mexicans
show for Brigadier-General Funston."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if he is let alone, he'll make them
respect the American flag," echoed Donald.</p>

<p>"Long may it wave!" was Adrian's sententious
comment.</p>

<p>But it did not wave long over Vera Cruz, for
the following November, Huerta having been
obliged to leave the country in the meantime and
Gen. Carranza having established himself for the
time being in the City of Mexico, the American
forces were withdrawn and the Carranza forces
took possession of Vera Cruz. Some months later
Carranza was recognized by the United States, and
at this writing is establishing his government, which
promises to be a continuation of the one established
by Madero.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that Santiago's work for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" href="#Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
his country was productive of good, as are all efforts
to bring liberty to the people and to free them
from the rule of a few.</p>

<p>Before sailing for home, the boys had the satisfaction
of knowing that the man known as Strong
had been properly punished, and that, in accordance
with Santiago's dying wish, the ten thousand
pounds which he had practically given to Billie
months before on the Rio Grande, were placed to
the lad's credit in the banking house of Don
Esteban.</p>

<p>The fate of Ambrosio, the ape which caused so
much trouble, was left in the hands of the keeper
of the prison to which Strong was sentenced. It is
to be hoped that his behavior will improve.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
